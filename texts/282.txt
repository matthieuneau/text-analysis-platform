hoodoos may be seismic gurus hoodoo prediction towering chimney - like sedimentary rock spires known as hoodoos may provide an indication of an area's past earthquake activity. the research by scientists including dr rasool anooshehpoor, from the united states nuclear regulatory commission, may provide scientists with a new tool to test the accuracy of current hazard models. hoodoo formations are often found in desert regions, and are common in north america, the middle east and northern africa. they are caused by the uneven weathering of different layers of sedimentary rocks, that leave boulders or thin caps of hard rock perched on softer rock. by knowing the strengths of different types of sedimentary layers, scientists can determine the amount of stress needed to cause those rocks to fracture. the united states geological survey ( usgs ) use seismic hazard models to predict the type of ground motion likely to occur in an area during a seismic event. but, according to anooshehpoor, these models lack long term data. " existing hazard maps use models based on scant data going back a hundred years or so, " says anooshehpoor. " but earthquakes have return periods lasting hundreds or thousands of years, so there is nothing to test these hazard models against. " the researchers examined two unfractured hoodoos within a few kilometres of the garlock fault, which is an active strike - slip fault zone in california's red rock canyon. their findings are reported in the bulletin of the seismological society of america. " although we can't put a precise age on hoodoos because of their erosion characteristics, we can use them to provide physical limits on the level of ground shaking that could
