benefits of xquery the principal benefits of xquery are : - expressiveness - xquery can query many different data structures and its recursive nature makes it ideal for querying tree and graph structures - brevity - xquery statements are shorter than similar sql or xslt programs - flexibility - xquery can query both hierarchical and tabular data - consistency - xquery has a consistent syntax and can be used with other xml standards such as xml schema datatypes xquery is frequently compared with two other languages, sql and xslt, but has a number of advantages over these. advantages over sql unlike sql, xquery returns not just tables but arbitrary tree structures. this allows xquery to directly create xhtml structures that can be used in web pages. xquery is for xml - based object databases, and object databases are much more flexible and powerful than databases which store in purely tabular format. unlike xslt, xquery can be learned by anyone familiar with sql. many of the constructs are very similar such as : - ordering results : both xquery and sql add an order byclause to the query. - selecting distinct values : both xquery and sql have easy ways to select distinct values from a result set - restricting rows : both xquery and sql have a where x = y clause that can be added to an xquery another big advantage is that xquery is essentially the native query language of the world wide web. one can query actual web pages with xquery, but not sql. even if one uses sql - based databases to store html / xhtml pages or fragments of such
