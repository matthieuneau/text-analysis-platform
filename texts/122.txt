most of us know someone with a food allergy. i certainly do - two of my children have been labeled with life threatening food allergies ; one to peanuts and tree nuts and the other to soy. every time i head to the grocery store i spend a tremendous amount of time reading each and every label - including labels that i am familiar with to be sure they haven ’ t changed. this is a necessity to keep my family safe and healthy. in january, 2006, the new food allergen labeling and consumer protection act ( falcpa ) took effect. the law requires food manufacturers to identify all ingredients in a food product containing one or more of the eight major allergens. the eight foods identified by the law are : - fish ( e. g., bass, flounder, cod ) - crustacean shellfish ( e. g. crab, lobster, shrimp ) - tree nuts ( e. g., almonds, walnuts, pecans ) the law states that the name of the food source of a major food allergen must appear : - in parentheses following the name of the ingredient. examples : “ lecithin ( soy ), ” “ flour ( wheat ), ” and “ whey ( milk ) ” – or – - immediately after or next to the list of ingredients in a “ contains ” statement. example : “ contains wheat, milk, and soy. ” most companies are very clear in their labeling and use the “ contains ” language in bold after their ingredient list. here ’ s where it gets really confusing i have been scrutinizing food labels for years - i am noticing that i have to squint these days to read the fine print.
