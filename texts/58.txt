( 1986 ) electromyographic activity over facial muscle regions can differentiate the valence and intensity of affective reactions. j pers soc psychol., 50 ( 2 ) : 260 - 8. download another simple physiological assesment is heart rate measured by the interbeat interval ( ibi ). for example, study by brosschot & thayer ( 2003 ) shows that heart rate response is longer after negative emotions than after positive emotions. brosschot jf, thayer jf. ( 2003 ) heart rate response is longer after negative emotions than after positive emotions. int j psychophysiol., in fact, the full spectrum of somatic measurements have been used along heart rate including pulse transmission time to the finger, skin conductance level or pupil dilation ( partala, 2003 ). all those are a bit less reliable methods and usually they detect arousal rather
