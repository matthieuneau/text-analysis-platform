beyond simple math and grouping ( like " ( x + 2 ) ( x - 4 ) " ), there are some functions you can use as well. look below to see them all. they are mostly standard functions written as you might expect. you can also use " pi " and " e " as their respective constants. please note : you should not use fractional exponents. for example, don't type " x ^ ( 1 / 3 ) " to compute the cube root of x. instead, use " root ( x, 3 ) ". when you want a quick graph of a function, you can just go to http : / / graphsketch. com / [ function ], like http : / / graphsketch. com / sin ( x ). you can even separate multiple equations with commas, like for more information on graphsketch ( how it works, etc. ), see my blog post
