- date : january 25, 2011 - in this story : asian tiger reserves can support more than 10, 000 wild tigers — three times the current estimate — if they are managed as large - scale landscapes that protect core breeding sites and benefit local communities, according to the world ’ s leading conservation scientists in a new study published on january 25. this positive news reveals that doubling the number of tigers in the wild is feasible. “ in the midst of a crisis, it ’ s tempting to circle the wagons and only protect a limited number of core protected areas, but we can and should do better, ” said dr. eric dinerstein, chief scientist at wwf and co - author of the study. “ we absolutely need to stop the bleeding, the poaching of tigers and their prey in core breeding areas, but we need to go much further and secure larger tiger landscapes before it is too late. ” wild tiger numbers have declined to as few as 3, 200 today compared to 100, 000 a century ago, due to poaching of tigers and their prey, habitat destruction and human - tiger conflict. “ a landscape - based conservation strategy to double the wild tiger population ” in the current issue of conservation letters provides the first assessment of the political commitment made by all 13 tiger range countries at november ’ s historic tiger summit to double the tiger population across asia by 2022. the study found that the 20 priority tiger conservation landscapes with the highest probability of long - term tiger survival could support more than 10, 500 tigers, including about 3, 400 breeding females. “ tiger conservation is the face of biodiversity conservation and competent sustainable land - use management at the landscape level, ” said study co - author dr. john seidensticker
