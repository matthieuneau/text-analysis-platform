in the earliest times, the many gods of the egyptians were unique children of one great god, the source of all life. among the many gods, none of them was considered to be the ultimate god. each was a free - willed portion of the great oneness which composed the most high god. even in genesis the plural form is used as the name of god, indicating that the one was composed of many, and the many contained the universal, omnipresent one. john van auken source : ancient egyptian mysticism and its relevance today, pages : 5
