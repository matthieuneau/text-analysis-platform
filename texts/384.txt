beginning in october 2006, some beekeepers began reporting losses of 30 - 90 percent of their hives. while colony losses are not unexpected during winter weather, the magnitude of loss suffered by some beekeepers was highly unusual. this phenomenon, which currently does not have a recognizable underlying cause, has been termed " colony collapse disorder " ( ccd ). the main symptom of ccd is simply no or a low number of adult honey bees present but with a live queen and no dead honey bees in the hive. often there is still honey in the hive, and immature bees ( brood ) are present. ars scientists and others are in the process of carrying out research to discover the cause ( s ) of ccd and develop ways for beekeepers to respond to the problem. why should the public care about honey bees? bee pollination is responsible for $ 15 billion in added crop value, particularly for specialty crops such as almonds and other nuts, berries, fruits, and vegetables. about one mouthful in three in the diet directly or indirectly benefits from honey bee pollination. while there are native pollinators ( honey bees came from the old world with european colonists ), honey bees are more prolific and the easiest to manage for the large scale pollination that u. s. agriculture requires. in california, the almond crop alone uses 1. 3 million colonies of bees, approximately one half of all honey bees in the united states, and this need is projected to grow to 1. 5 million colonies by 2010. the number of managed honey bee colonies has dropped from 5 million in the1940s to only 2. 5 million today. at the same time, the call for hives to supply pollination service has continued to climb
