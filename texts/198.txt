talk : 20. 109 ( f12 ) pre - proposal : engineering viral magnetic nanoparticles for magnetic hyperthermic cancer therapy - this is a brainstorming page. you are very welcome to write any crazy / non - crazy / inventive / conventional / knowledgeable ideas or information you may have about our project. some key words : magnetic nanoparticles ( mnp ), viruses, magnetic hyperthermia, bioengineering what is magnetic hyperthermia? how it works? under an alternating magnetic field, mnp releases heat due to relaxation of magnetic moments ( hysteresis ). this can cause an increase in temperature to the range of 41c to 47c. since tumor cells are more heat sensitive than normal cells, they will be killed by this thermal dissipation. here is an interesting tidbit from a paper i was reading : " in addition to the expected tumor cell death, hyperthermia treatment has also induced unexpected biological responses, such as tumor - specific immune responses as a result of heat - shock protein expression. these results suggest that hyperthermia is able to kill not only local tumors exposed to heat treatment, but also tumors at distant sites, including metastatic cancer cells. " ( kobayashi ) - clinical trials in prostate cancer - shows promising results when coupled with irradiation on breast cancer ( mouse ) current limitations ( this information will help us shape and define the problem. ) ( 1 ) to achieve the necessary rise in temperature with minimal dose of mnp. - in other words, this means : - high specific loss power / specific absorption rate ( slp ) of the mnp. - why is higher applied dosage bad? > leads to unnecessary
