labrador retriever originated in newfoundland, canada. small water dogs were used to retrieve birds and fish ; they even pulled small boats through the water. their strong desire to work, versatility, and waterproof coats impressed fishermen, one of whom brought a dog back to england with him. lord malmsbury saw this dog, then called a st. john ’ s dog, and imported several from newfoundland. lord malmsbury is credited with having started to call the dogs labradors, although the reason is lost to history. eventually, the english quarantine stopped additional imports from coming into the country, and the labradors already in england were cross - bred to other retrievers. however, breed fanciers soon put a stop to that, and the breed as we know it today was born. labrador retriever is probably the most popular dog breed in the world. labrador retriever is a medium - sized, strongly built dog breed that retains its hunting and working instincts. standing between 21. 5 and 24. 5 inches tall and weighing between 55 and 80 pounds, with females smaller than males, the breed is compact and well - balanced. labrador retrievers have short, weather - resistant coats that can be yellow, black, or chocolate. the head is broad, the eyes are friendly, and the tail is otterlike. grooming a labrador retriever is not difficult, although it is amazing how much the coat can shed at times. shedding is worst in spring and fall when the short, dense undercoat and coarser outer coat lose all the dead hair. brushing daily during these times will lessen the amount of hair in the house. photo : labrador retriever puppies – brown, black and yellow. labrador retrieve
