viewed against a dangerous and costly backdrop, clear team communication is obviously essential to create a safe, productive and effective work environment on the ramp. tractor operators and wing walkers need to warn each other of impending dangers. the tractor operator needs to keep the flight deck informed of ground movement. and all ground personnel should at least be able to hear the flight deck and each other during a pushback. ramp workers can do much more without the wire, the shouting or the hand signals. a typical wireless pushback and towing configuration uses a portable transceiver for continuous two - way communication among one or more wing walkers and the tractor operator during aircraft movement. the tractor operator is free to concentrate on correct maneuvering, and all crew members can warn others instantly of impending dangers. to optimize the flow of communication and minimize chatter, the system is configured so that all team members can hear the pilot, but only the tractor operator can talk directly to the flight deck. because wireless communication increases coordination and enables real - time verbal warnings, it decreases the risk of accidents, shortens turn - around times, and increases the likelihood of hitting flight slots. in addition to pushbacks and towing, wireless team communication systems can also be used to improve safety and efficiency during deicing, cargo and maintenance operations. in a deicing configuration, a wireless system connects the driver and the basket, and the system itself can be connected to two - way radios enabling communication with remote users. communication between the driver and the basket takes place on open microphone over a 1. 9ghz ( 1. 8ghz in the eu ) encrypted frequency while also allowing radio monitoring and transmitting with a push to - talk button on the headsets. systems can be
