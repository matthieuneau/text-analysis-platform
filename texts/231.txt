w hy is it important for scientists to contribute to science education? our nation has failed to meet important educational challenges, and our children are ill prepared to respond to the demands of today? s world. results of the third international mathematics and science study ( timss ) - - and its successor, timss - r - - show that the relatively strong international performance of u. s. 4th graders successively deteriorates across 8th - and 12th - grade cohorts. related studies indicate that u. s. prek - 12 curricula lack coherence, depth, and continuity and cover too many topics superficially. by high school, unacceptably low numbers of students show motivation or interest in enrolling in physics ( only one - quarter of all students ) or chemistry ( only one - half ). we are rapidly approaching universal participation at the postsecondary level, but we still have critical science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ( stem ) workforce needs and too few teachers who have studied science or mathematics. science and engineering degrees as a percentage of the degrees conferred each year have remained relatively constant at about 5 %. in this group, women and minorities are gravely underrepresented. the consequences of these conditions are serious. the u. s. department of labor estimates that 60 % of the new jobs being created in our economy today will require technological literacy, yet only 22 % of the young people entering the job market now actually possess those skills. by 2010, all jobs will require some form of technological literacy, and 80 % of those jobs haven? t even been created yet. we must prepare our students for a world that we ourselves cannot completely anticipate. this will require the active involvement
