quantum time waits for no quantum theory, also quantum mechanics, in physics, a theory based on using the concept of the quantum unit to describe the dynamic properties of subatomic particles and the interactions of matter and radiation. the foundation was laid by the german physicist max planck, who postulated in 1900 that energy can be emitted or absorbed by matter only in small, discrete units called quanta. fundamental to the development of quantum mechanics was the uncertainty principle, formulated by the german physicist werner heisenberg in 1927, which states that the position and momentum of a subatomic particle cannot be specified simultaneously. spectral lines of atomic hydrogen : when an electron makes a transition from one energy level to another, the electron emits a photon with a particular energy. these photons are then observed as emission lines using a spectroscope. the lyman series involves transitions to the lowest or ground state energy level. to the second energy level are called the balmer series. these transitions involve frequencies in the visible part of the spectrum. in this frequency range each transition is characterized by a in the 18th and 19th centuries, newtonian, or classical, mechanics appeared to provide a wholly accurate description of the motions of bodies — for example, planetary motion. in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, however, experimental findings raised doubts about the completeness of newtonian theory. among the newer observations were the lines that appear in the spectra of light emitted by heated gases, or gases in which electric discharges take place. model of the atom developed in the early 20th century by the english physicist ernest rutherford, in which negatively charged electrons circle a positive nucleus in orbits prescribed by newton ’ s laws of motion, scientists had also expected that the electrons would emit light
