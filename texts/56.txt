reversal of fortune to unlock the vast, untapped potential of the world ’ s drylands, we must learn from the people who live in them, says dr jonathan davies. drylands are a major global biome, home to a great diversity of species and some of our most treasured natural heritage. they are also home to over 2 billion people and in the developing world in particular they are associated with poverty and social inequity. global development and environment goals are not being met in the drylands : by 2015 many dryland regions are set to fail to achieve the millennium development goals, whilst progress towards the goals and objectives of the un environmental conventions ( the convention to combat desertification and the convention on biological diversity in particular ) is generally poor. recent experiences in the drylands of emerging countries, such as china and india, illustrate that economic development in drylands can outpace that in areas that are usually considered “ high potential ”. although development is often associated with degradation, experiences in sub saharan africa illustrate that economic development can be greatly enhanced through protection of biodiversity as a source of income. by taking an even broader, global view of drylands and examining industrialised dryland countries, it becomes clear that for every seemingly - insurmountable challenge we are able to find evidence of a viable solution somewhere in the world. to address the challenges of the drylands, we need to understand their unique features and how these have to be managed. perhaps the most important of these is climate unpredictability : the amount of precipitation varies enormously between areas, between seasons and between years. the sheer magnitude of this uncertainty is hard to grasp, but in many drylands the normal range of rainfall, drought - years aside
