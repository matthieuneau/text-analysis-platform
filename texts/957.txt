diagnosing mesothelioma : mris magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) is one of several imaging techniques that doctors use to detect, stage and evaluate the progression of mesothelioma. these non - invasive scans use magnets and radio waves to help doctors visualize a patient ’ s organs, tissues, bones and tumors. many radiologists consider mris ideal for viewing the anatomical structures of the chest and abdomen – including the pleura and peritoneum, where mesothelioma tumors most commonly develop. the first commercial mri units emerged in the 1980s. since then, the technology has advanced considerably. modern mri units use superconductor magnets and coils to produce a constant magnetic field, as well as radiofrequency energy to measure signals from the nuclei of hydrogen atoms inside the body. computers inside the scanner register these signals and turn them into images. most modern units also include a shield, which prevents the scanner from picking up interference from outside signals sources like televisions and radio stations. mris work by aligning the water molecules in your body. radio waves then cause these aligned particles to emit signals, which register on the scanner. the images reflect the amount of activity that is occurring in each internal structure. each mri - generated image shows a thin slice of the body. the mri process the entire mri process takes about an hour or two to complete. the scan itself takes between 30 and 60 minutes, but the appointment also includes pre - scan positioning and other preparation activities. once patients arrive at the mri center and fill out their paperwork, they must remove all metal objects from their bodies. the strong magnets in an mri scanner can attract zippered clothing, jewelry,
