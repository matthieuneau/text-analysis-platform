xantusiidae is a clade of viviparous ( live bearing ) lizards that ranges from southwestern north america and baja california ( xantusia ) into central america ( lepidophyma ) and cuba ( cricosaura ). xantusia magdalena occurs in baja california. xantusiidae is a relatively small clade, with 3 genera and approximately 30 living species. lepidophyma is the most speciose ( ~ 17 species ), whereas cricosaura is monotypic. xantusiids have a reasonably good fossil record extending from the mid - paleocene onward in western north america. xantusiids are fascinating lizards for several reasons. first, although they are almost uniformly diminuitive ( xantusia magdalena measures less than 4 cm snout - vent length, and the largest xantusiid species measure about 10 cm snout - vent length ), xantusiids generally take several years to reach sexual maturity, and several species give birth to just 1 or 2 offspring. it is a more usual reproductive strategy for small lizards to mature quickly and produce large numbers of offspring, to increase their chances of survival. despite this low reproductive potential, xantusiid neonates actually have a high life expectancy ; this can be attributed at least in part to their secretive lifestyle, which leads to the second reason why xantusiids are particularly interesting - - microhabitat specialization. microhabitat specialization is an ecological hallmark of xantusiidae. many populations are narrowly restricted to specific niches - - crevices ( e. g., xantusia henshawi in exfoliating granitic cap rocks ), interstic
