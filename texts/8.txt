mexican america - introduction " mexican america " is a sampling of objects from the collections of the national museum of american history. the stories behind these objects reflect the history of the mexican presence in the united states. they illustrate a fundamentally american story about the centuries - old encounter between distinct ( yet sometimes overlapping ) communities that have coexisted but also clashed over land, culture, and livelihood. who, where, and what is mexico? over time, the definitions and boundaries of mexico have changed. the aztec empire and the area where nahautl was spoken — today the region surrounding modern mexico city — was known as mexico. for 300 years, the spanish colonizers renamed it new spain. when mexico was reborn in 1821 as a sovereign nation, its borders stretched from california to guatemala. it was a huge and ancient land of ethnically, linguistically, and economically diverse regions that struggled for national unity. texas, ( then part of the mexican state of coahuila y tejas ) was a frontier region far from the dense cities and fertile valleys of central mexico, a place where immigrants were recruited from the united states. the immigrants in turn declared the mexican territory an independent republic in 1836 ( later a u. s. state ), making the state the first cauldron of mexican american culture. by 1853, the government of mexico, the weaker neighbor of an expansionist united states, had lost what are today the states of california, nevada, utah, arizona, new mexico, texas, and parts of colorado and wyoming. in spite of the imposition of a new border, the historical and living presence of spaniards, mexicans, indigenous peoples, and their mixed descendants remained a defining force in the creation of the american west.
