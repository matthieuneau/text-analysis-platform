dinosaur bones " buried " by evolutionists! a recent presentation at the 2012 western pacific geophysics meeting in singapore showed c - 14 dates of soft tissue found in dinosaur bones to be in the range from 22, 000 - 39, 000 years old. previously, it has been assumed that dinosaurs died out over 65 million years ago, so these new findings are astonishing and should have made international news. but shortly after the presentation was made at the meeting, the abstract was removed from the meeting ’ s website! so it appears that instead of making international news, these findings have been buried. first, let ’ s look at what was actually being presented. the organic matter ( collagen ) and hard carbonate bone mineral ( bioapatite ) in the bone samples were analyzed. the samples came from several species of dinosaurs ( acrocanthosaur, hadrosaurus, triceratops and apatosaurus ) taken from various sites in texas, colorado, arkansas and montana. the samples were meticulously handled and cleaned to avoid possible contamination. the carbon - 14 ( c - 14 ) levels in these samples were measured using accelerator mass spectrometry ( ams ). the resultant c - 14 ages obtained from these samples were consistently in the 22, 000 - 39, 000 years range. the fact that the samples were from a variety of species and sites all giving consistent results greatly reduces the chance that the results are from contamination. the theoretical upper limit for c - 14 dating is ten times the half - life, or about 57, 000 years. the proposed practical upper limit for c - 14 dating is between 40, 000 - 50, 000 years. while some samples fell close to the 40, 000 year upper limit,
