( just kidding, vegans! ) whether or not you do eat them, you certainly don ’ t want to waste any of the precious meat — and that ’ s what normally happens when a machine, not a human, tries to butcher an animal. after all, each animal is a different size and shape. enter automated lamb boning. developed by scott technology ltd, a new zealand - based lamb exporter, this process uses x - ray technology to measure the inner dimensions of a lamb carcass to make cuts accurate and reduce waste. using the x - ray of each carcass, the 100 % automated processing plant can adjust its robotic arms, claws, grippers, torso impalers and conveyor belts to make the most accurate cuts. watch the video ( not for the squeamish ) to see how efficiently it produces crown racks, chops and more. related on smartplanet : - video : machine scoops up, deposits ketchup — in same shape - self - sculpting sand assembles itself into shapes - small, speedy robots zip, roll and swarm through the air - lockheed martin debuts maple seed - inspired drone - video : scientists create micro - robots that form assembly lines via : popular science
