killing emacs means ending the execution of the emacs process. if you started emacs from a terminal, the parent process normally resumes control. the low - level primitive for killing emacs is this command calls the hook kill - emacs - hook, then exits the emacs process and kills it. if exit - data is an integer, that is used as the exit status of the emacs process. ( this is useful primarily in batch operation ; see batch mode. ) if exit - data is a string, its contents are stuffed into the terminal input buffer so that the shell ( or whatever program next reads input ) can read them. kill - emacs function is normally called via the higher - level command c - x c - c save - buffers - kill - terminal ). see exiting. it is also called automatically if emacs receives a sighup operating system signal ( e. g., when the controlling terminal is disconnected ), or if it receives a sigint signal while running in batch mode ( see batch mode ). this normal hook is run by kill - emacs, before it kills emacs. kill - emacscan be called in situations where user interaction is impossible ( e. g., when the terminal is disconnected ), functions on this hook should not attempt to interact with the user. if you want to interact with the user when emacs is shutting down, use kill - emacs - query - functions, described below. when emacs is killed, all the information in the emacs process, aside from files that have been saved, is lost. because killing emacs inadvertently can lose a lot
