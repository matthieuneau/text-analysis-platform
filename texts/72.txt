creator : gust, iris description : the brochure promotes urban transportation policy to increase the use of renewable energy to 100 %. seen globally, transport is one of the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions. yet fossil fuels are becoming scarce, will become increasingly expensive and will eventually stop being viable as transport fuels. before this happens, climate change will have begun to have a serious impact on human lives. the authors believe that it is crucial to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy as soon as possible, especially in the transport sector. making urban transport independent of fossil fuel is a great challenge, but the authors cite growing evidence that it can be achieved. contributing partner : unt libraries
