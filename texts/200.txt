[ en ] numerous works are related to the use of unconventional feed resources, and particularly to mucuna spp., in poultry diet. this review aims at describing the context of their use, their nutritional values and the constraints related to their upgrading, before considering the effects of the various methods of treatment on the reduction of the toxic substances that they could contain and on their chemical compositions. the methods of treatment are very variable and their standardisation should allow using them in rural area. those feed could thus constitute an alternative to costly conventional feed usually used in poultry production. administration generale de la cooperation au developpement - agcd
