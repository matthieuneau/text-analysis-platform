arctic meltdown not caused by nature rapid loss of arctic sea ice - 80 per cent has disappeared since 1980 - is not caused by natural cycles such as changes in the earth's orbit around the sun, says dr karl. the situation is getting rather messy with regard to the ice melting in the arctic. now the volume of the ice varies throughout the year, rising to its peak after midwinter, and falling to its minimum after midsummer, usually in the month of september. over most of the last 1, 400 years, the volume of ice remaining each september has stayed pretty constant. but since 1980, we have lost 80 per cent of that ice. now one thing to appreciate is that over the last 4. 7 billion years, there have been many natural cycles in the climate â€” both heating and cooling. what's happening today in the arctic is not a cycle caused by nature, but something that we humans did by burning fossil fuels and dumping slightly over one trillion tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere over the last century. so what are these natural cycles? there are many many of them, but let's just look at the milankovitch cycles. these cycles relate to the earth and its orbit around the sun. there are three main milankovitch cycles. they each affect how much solar radiation lands on the earth, and whether it lands on ice, land or water, and when it lands. the first milankovitch cycle is that the orbit of the earth changes from mostly circular to slightly elliptical. it does this on a predominantly 100, 000 - year cycle. when the earth is close to the sun it receives more heat energy, and when it is further away it gets less. at the moment the orbit of the
