fixing math education 2 aka " drill - n - kill " vs " inquiry based " aka " traditional " vs " progressive " notice how some terms just naturally sound better than others? does that have anything to do with the substance of the ideas? so there's really no general agreement on what constructivism is. some people argue it's not curriculum or pedagogy, it's brain science. i simply use it to refer to those approaches of teaching mathematics that require students to develop their own mathematics from scratch. it might include " problem solving, " " discovery learning, " and " inquiry - based learning ( ibl ). " my apologies to those who will claim that i do violence to their pet definitions here. but there do seem to be two general camps. on the one hand we have those who think students should learn efficient, time - tested methods of solving problems, and learn them to mastery ( automation ). these i call " traditionalists. " on the other hand, we have those who emphasize that students should learn to think creatively, develop strategies to solve novel problems, and develop deep insights into mathematics. these i call " constructivists. " the answer is actually simple. we need both. however, when sacrifices must be made, there is one approach that is essential, and one that is merely desirable. unfortunately, reasonable people will disagree about which is which. this, however, is my blog, so my opinion is right. the much - maligned traditional method is essential. we must first realize that there is a great deal of disinformation floating around about the traditional method. its opponents claim the traditional method teaches rote memorization without understanding or thinking. except perhaps in
