problem : an oil drilling rig located 14 miles off of a straight coastline is to be connected by a pipeline to a renery 10 miles down the coast from the point directly opposite the drilling rig. laying pipe under water costs 500, 000 dollars per mile. laying pipe on land costs 300, 000 dollars per mile. what combination of underwater and land - based pipe will minimize the total cost of the pipeline? for now i'd just like help drawing the picture because in my eyes this is very poorly written. so can someone help me out with a picture for this?
