fertilizer facts : april 1997, number 15 response of oat to water and nitrogen land resources and environmental sciences dept. montana state university nitrogen ( n ) is the most common nutrient that limits oat production in montana. deficiency symptoms are frequently characterized by general chlorosis ( yellowing ) of leaves and a reduction in overall plant vigor and growth. oat n deficiency symptoms, as with other cereal grains, will most often appear in the early to late spring depending on severity. once present, symptoms become more severe through vegetative growth stages. at flowering, n deficient plants are stunted and have fewer tillers and smaller heads than healthy plants. grain yield is reduced primarily through a reduction in kernels per head and head density. nitrogen typically represents a grower's largest fertilizer input cost. current fertilizer n recommendations in montana are based on an average relationship between n requirement ( nr ) and estimated yield potential [ yield potential ( bu / a ) x 1. 1 = nr ( lbs / a ) ] ( table 1 ). the recommendation assumes 1. 1 lbs n / a are needed to produce each bushel of grain. however, this relation may vary with growing season and the yield potential at an individual site. since yield potential is most closely associated with available water ( stored soil water + growing season precipitation ), we were interested in determining the effects of available water supply on the n requirement and oat yield potential. field experiments were conducted on a lohmiller silty clay loam ( ustic torrifluvents ) at the southern agricultural research center near huntley during 1993 and 1994. initial soil n levels ( 0 - 36 in. depth ) were 15 and 22 lbs /
