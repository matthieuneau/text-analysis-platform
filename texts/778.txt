dwc is prone to root rot, always due to low do * altitude play an important role in how much do a solution can carry. if you reduce your nute loads, your solution can carry more do. if you live in denver, you may have a problem indoor growing with any temps above 65Âºf if you check out roseypanties experiment, you will see he had much better result using a reduced nute load. there were two positive effects on the plants, that were grown using the reduced nute load. the first good thing that happened was, his do increased, due to the reduced salinity, of his nutrient solution. second, osmotic pressure was reduced in the rhyzome, allowing the plant to take in more h2o and thus grow faster. what does this second statement really mean? take your hand, and leave it in salt water for an hour. your skin wrinkles,... why? because the salt has caused the osmotic pressure on the outdside of your skin to be higher than the pressure inside your skin, and as the water in your hand is sucked out through your skin, your hand actually shrinks from the loss of fluid and the skin becomes loose it is harder for your plant to uptake water and nutrients when you use high nute loads, because the salt creates negative osmotic pressure ( hypertonicity ) against the semipermeable membrane of the root cell walls. here is the wiki " scientific answer ". osmotic pressure is the hydrostatic pressure produced by a solution in a space divided by a semipermeable membrane ( your roots ) due to a differential in the concentrations of solute. os
