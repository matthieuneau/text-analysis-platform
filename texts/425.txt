catholic and protestant reformers in the 16th century occasionally spoke scornfully of anabaptists as " new monks, " referring to anabaptist insistence on holy living and intense spiritual life ( e. g., ta elsa√ü 1, 110 - 13 ). anabaptists occasionally accepted the comparison ( klassen, william and walter klaassen, eds. and trans. the writings of pilgram marpeck, classics of the radical reformation, vol. 2. scottdale, pa : herald press, 1978 : 217 ) but more frequently rejected it ( klassen & klaassen : 215 - 16 ; menno, writings, 369, 401 ), in part because monks often came from the socially privileged classes. several scholars have used monastic history as an aid to interpret anabaptism ( troeltsch, ritschl, davis, snyder, martin ). many anabaptists and mennonites, beginning with the hutterite chronicle, pointed to quasi - monastic sectarian medieval movements, especially waldenses, as forerunners of anabaptism ( these theories are promulgated or discussed by keller, gratz, verduin, durnbaugh ). one of the most extensive efforts to relate monasticism and anabaptism drew on both monastic and quasi - monastic traditions ( davis ). most scholars have carefully limited their interpretations to pointing out " intellectual parallels " or general similarities ; some have argued for direct continuity and influence. the crucial interpretive question revolves around the nature of monasticism : is it a nonconforming sectarian development critical of the institutional church ( workman ) or an intensified institutional core of the ecclesiastical
