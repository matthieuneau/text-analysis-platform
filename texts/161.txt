we have in this chapter to consider why the females of many birds have not acquired the same ornaments as the male ; and why, on the other hand, both sexes of many other birds are equally, or almost equally, ornamented? in the following chapter we shall consider the few cases in which the female is more conspicuously coloured than the male. in my origin of species * i briefly suggested that the long tail of the peacock would be inconvenient and the conspicuous black colour of the male capercailzie dangerous, to the female during the period of incubation : and consequently that the transmission of these characters from the male to the female offspring had been checked through natural selection. i still think that this may have occurred in some few instances : but after mature reflection on all the facts which i have been able to collect, i am now inclined to believe that when the sexes differ, the successive variations have generally been from the first limited in their transmission to the same sex in which they first arose. since my remarks appeared, the subject of sexual colouration has been discussed in some very interesting papers by mr. wallace, * ( 2 ) who believes that in almost all cases the successive variations tended at first to be transmitted equally to both sexes ; but that the female was saved, through natural selection, from acquiring the conspicuous colours of the male, owing to the danger which she would thus have incurred during incubation. * fourth edition, 1866, p. 241. * ( 2 ) westminster review, july, 1867. journal of travel, vol. i., 1868, p. 73. this view necessitates a tedious discussion on a difficult point, namely, whether the transmission of a character,
