the test team views the use of a pulley as an intermediate step only, and has planned to shift to a reliance on windlasses like those that apparently were used to hoist sails on egyptian ships. " the whole approach has been to downgrade the technology, " gharib said. " we first wanted to show that a kite could raise a huge weight at all. now that we're raising larger and larger stones, we're also preparing to replace the steel scaffolding with wooden poles and the steel pulleys with wooden pulleys like the ones they may have used on egyptian ships. " for gharib, the idea of accomplishing heavy tasks with limited manpower is appealing from an engineer's standpoint because it makes more logistical sense. " you can imagine how hard it is to coordinate the activities of hundreds if not thousands of laborers to accomplish an intricate task, " said gharib. " it's one thing to send thousands of soldiers to attack another army on a battlefield. but an engineering project requires everything to be put precisely into place. " i prefer to think of the technology as simple, with relatively few people involved, " he explained. gharib and graff came up with a way of building a simple structure around the obelisk, with a pulley system mounted in front of the stone. that way, the base of the obelisk would drag on the ground for a few feet as the kite lifted the stone, and the stone would be quite stable once it was pulled upright into a vertical position. if the obelisk were raised with the base as a pivot, the stone would tend to swing past the vertical position and fall the other way
