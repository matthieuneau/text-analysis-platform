refraction and acceleration name : christopher s. why is it that when light travels from a more dense to a less dense medium, its speed is higher? i've read answers to this question in your archives but, sadly, still don't get it. one answer ( jasjeet s bagla ) says that we must not ask the question because light is massless, hence questions of acceleration don't make sense. it does, however, seem to be ok to talk about different speeds of light. if you start at one speed and end at a higher one, why is one not allowed to talk about acceleration? bagla goes on to say that it depends on how the em fields behave in a given medium. it begs the question : what is it about, say, perspex and air that makes light accelerate, oops, travel at different speeds? if you're dealing with the same ray of light, one is forced to speak of acceleration, no? what other explanation is there for final velocity > initial velocity? arthur smith mentioned a very small " evanescent " component that travels ahead at c. where can i learn more about this? sorry for the long question. i understand that f = ma and if there is no m, you cannot talk about a, but, again, you have one velocity higher than another for the same thing. i need to know more than " that's just the way em fields are! " an explanation that satisfies me relates to travel through an interactive medium. when light interacts with an atom, the photon of light is absorbed and then emitted. for a moment, the energy of the light is within the atom. this causes a slight
