the richboro elementary meadow project students in the richboro elementary ecology club have been planting a meadow each year since 2008. we were the first school in council rock school district to do so, and our project has inspired the district to plant four acres of meadows at several other council rock school locations. why plant meadows? meadows provide habitats for more insects and other animals than green lawns. the first year we planted the meadow, we found two praying mantids had moved in! additionally, meadows do not need to be mowed more than once a year, so they save fossil fuel. below are photos and descriptions of our current meadow as well as meadows from previous years. the fourth planting of richboro elementary school's meadow students in the richboro elementary school ecology club planted its fourth meadow this spring. students sowed the flower seeds harvested last fall in the newly prepared plot. additional native seeds, including sunflower and asters, were planted. students and teachers look forward to seeing what surprises await when returning to school in the fall. the third planting of richboro elementary school ’ s meadow the ecology club at richboro elementary school planted its meadow for a third growing season this april. using seeds harvested from the meadow last fall, the club members, ranging from grades two through five, took turns planting seeds in a grid - like pattern across the meadow plot. sunflower seeds were pushed into the ground with planting sticks, and the soil was raked to cover the seeds. as the club ended, the clouds gathered and watered the meadow, as if on cue. we look forward to watching our garden bloom as the seasons turn. richboro elementary school ’ s meadow the ecology club at richboro elementary school planted its meadow for a second
