noaa scientists agree the risks are high, but say hansen overstates what science can really say for sure jim hansen at the university of colorado ’ s world affairs conference ( photo : tom yulsman ) speaking to a packed auditorium at the university of colorado ’ s world affairs conference on thursday, nasa climatologist james hansen found a friendly audience for his argument that we face a planetary emergency thanks to global warming. despite the fact that the temperature rise has so far been relatively modest, “ we do have a crisis, ” he said. with his characteristic under - stated manner, hansen made a compelling case. but after speaking with two noaa scientists today, i think hansen put himself in a familiar position : out on a scientific limb. and after sifting through my many pages of notes from two days of immersion in climate issues, i ’ m as convinced as ever that journalists must be exceedingly careful not to overstate what we know for sure and what is still up for scientific debate. crawling out on the limb, hansen argued that global warming has already caused the levels of water in lake powell and lake mead — the two giant reservoirs on the colorado river than insure water supplies for tens of millions of westerners — to fall to 50 percent of capacity. the reservoirs “ probably will not be full again unless we decrease co2 in the atmosphere, ” he asserted. hansen is arguing that simply reducing our emissions and stabilizing co2 at about 450 parts per million, as many scientists argue is necessary, is not nearly good enough. we must reduce the concentration from today ’ s 387 ppm to below 35o ppm. “ we have already passed into the dangerous zone, ” hansen said. if we don
