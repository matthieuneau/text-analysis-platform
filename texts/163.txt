use of biomedical engineering and music for k - 12 math / science education the study proposes the use of biomedical engineering ( bme ) ph. d. track graduate students to assist middle and high school teachers to teach math / science skills, by providing additional tools and training to optimize their use. the emphasis is on the use of disciplinary knowledge to enhance how people learn with the aid of computer technology ; showing the students the importance of this knowledge to solve real world problems. three school districts have committed to participate in a cross - disciplinary education program ( shelby county, shades mountain independent, and the alabama school of fine arts ). students from uab â€™ s biomedical engineering ( bme ) and the alabama school of fine arts ( asfa ) departments will develop, implement, and evaluate the four interventions used to enhance math / science skills. - music education - math / science kits and six - week projects - science fair project development - a technology of fine arts class when the cost - effectiveness of each intervention has been determined, decisions whether to expand the intervention, within each school system will be made. information about successful programs would be made available, on the internet or other media, to interested groups. trained personnel from this project would serve as facilitators for these groups. - investigators : a. eberhardt, r. thompson, m. froning, d. kilpadi
