ulva spp. on freshwater - influenced or unstable upper eulittoral rock ecological and functional relationships the community predominantly consists of algae which cover the rock surface and creates a patchy canopy. in doing so, the algae provides an amenable habitat in an otherwise hostile environment, exploitable on a temporary basis by other species. for instance, ulva intestinalis provides shelter for the orange harpacticoid copepod, tigriopus brevicornis, and the chironomid larva of halocladius fucicola ( mcallen, 1999 ). the copepod and chironomid species utilize the hollow thalli of ulva intestinalis as a moist refuge from desiccation when rockpools completely dry. several hundred individuals of tigriopus brevicornis have been observed in a single thallus of ulva intestinalis ( mcallen, 1999 ). the occasional grazing gastropods that survive in this biotope no doubt graze ulva. seasonal and longer term change - during the winter, elevated levels of freshwater runoff would be expected owing to seasonal rainfall. also, winter storm action may disturb the relatively soft substratum of chalk and firm mud, or boulders may be overturned. - seasonal fluctuation in the abundance of ulva spp. would therefore be expected with the biotope thriving in winter months. porphyra also tends to be regarded as a winter seaweed, abundant from late autumn to the succeeding spring, owing to the fact that the blade shaped fronds of the gametophyte develop in early autumn, whilst the microscopic filamentous stages of the spring and summer are less apparent ( see recruitment process, below ).
