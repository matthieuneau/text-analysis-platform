groundhogs, as a species, have a large range in size. there are the medium - sized rodents i grew up with, averaging around 4 kg, and groundhogs — like a certain phil — that are probably more like 14 kg. this is the likely source of my earlier confusion, as that's a huge discrepancy in size. evidently, it's all in the diet, much like humans. where i grew up, in rural northern minnesota, we called the groundhog a woodchuck ; i thought that the groundhog was some fat cat, east coast, liberal rodent. as it would turn out, they are actually one in the same creature — marmota monax, a member of the squirrel family. woodchucks spend a lot of their time in burrows. it is their safe haven from their many predators, and they are quick to flee to it at the first sign of danger. they will sometimes emit a loud whistle on their way to alert others in the area that something is awry. groundhogs enjoy raiding our gardens and digging up sod, thereby destroying what we've spent countless hours toiling upon. look for groundhog signs. you might not even know there is a groundhog around until your garden has been devoured or your tractor damaged by a collapsed groundhog den. things to look for are large nibble marks on your prized veggies, gnaw marks on the bark of young fruit trees, root vegetables pulled up ( or their tops trimmed off ), groundhog - sized holes ( 25 – 30 cm ) anywhere near your garden, or mounds of dirt near said holes. if you see these signs, take action. don
