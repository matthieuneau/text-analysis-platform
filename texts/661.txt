by bruce boyers, our system of factory agriculture is exacting a great toll on our planet : 40 percent of the land and 70 percent of the fresh water on earth is devoted to the growing of food, which, in the process, creates some 30 percent of greenhouse gases. compounding these issues is the fact that commercial produce is often transported thousands or even tens of thousands of miles to its point of sale, consuming tons of fossil fuel. it is evident that our current agricultural model is a failed experiment in search of a more sustainable solution. in an effort to bring needed fresh produce closer to home with far greater sustainability, a movement in urban agriculture is rapidly gaining momentum. new york city, having such a large and diverse population, is a metropolis ripe for green urban agriculture and is now home to an innovative commercial operation called gotham greens. gotham greens has now gone into full production and is providing much - needed locally and sustainably grown produce for the greater new york city area. " my partners and i had a vision for a local farm operation here in new york city that could provide new yorkers - which would include restaurants, retailers and consumers - with premium quality, fresh, nutritious culinary herbs and greens, salad greens and lettuces, " puri said. " they would be grown year round so that we could reliably and consistently supply our customers with local produce. obviously our climate in new york doesn't support year - round agriculture of a lot of these crops, so we thought we would try to do something in a greenhouse. a greenhouse climate allows you to potentially grow year round, at the same time protecting crops against extreme or detrimental weather events.
