the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) has warned computer users that e - mails from scam artists pretending to be fbi agents are spreading a computer virus. the e - mails tell recipients that the fbi's internet fraud complaint center has monitored their internet use and found they have accessed illegal web sites. the e - mails then direct recipients to open an attachment and complete a questionnaire. this is a bogus message. the attachment contains a computer virus. do not open or launch the attachment. you should delete the e - mail immediately. as a general rule, if you receive an e - mail that you are not expecting, even if you know the sender, do not open it or launch the attachment and do not forward the message. if you are not sure, contact the sender to verify the e - mail. otherwise, delete the e - mail. the information and network security team has put in place appropriate protections to prevent the virus from spreading. current anti - virus definitions detect and block this virus.
