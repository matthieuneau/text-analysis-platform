here's a fine think - piece by susan cain that praises some introversion as indispensable for creativity. to some great extent, socrates and jesus were solitary men. and the wisdom they shared with us couldn't have been captured in group reports or multi - authored articles. not only that, we live in a society that discourages, in so many ways, thinking for ourselves. we defer so readily to public opinion, fashion, and what the experts say and the studies show. most studies that show stuff have a lot more than one author. most books that change our lives have only one, and we don't live in a time when many are being written. just about every good play or novel or painting, of course, has its source in the vision of a single artist. we also see, of course, that in the disciplines that require deep thought and personal interpretation ( such as philosophy — especially political philosophy — and history ), articles almost only have one author. technical and scientific reports usually have more authors than they do pages. if we want learning to be personal, personal thought has to be encouraged and rewarded. and persons, of course, have to be held personally responsible for both what they've learned and the ways in which they have expressed their thoughts. in a class dealing with " real books " ( such as ones written by plato or kant or jane austen or pascal or simone weil ), i find that the best students get less than ten percent of what's really going on, and " what's gotten " differs dramatically from student to student. if they had to produce a multi - authored paper, the result would be flattened out to what they can explain to each other
