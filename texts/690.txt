july 31, 1998 explanation : do you recognize the constellation orion? this striking but unfamiliar looking picture of the familiar orion region of the sky was produced using survey data from the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ). it combines information recorded at three different invisible infrared wavelengths in a red, green, and blue color scheme and covers about 30x24 degrees on the sky. most of orion's visually impressive stars don't stand out, but bright betelgeuse does appear as a small purplish dot just above center. immediately to the right of betelgeuse and prominent in the iras skyview, expanding debris from a stellar explosion, a supernova remnant, is seen as a large bright ring - shaped feature. the famous gas clouds in orion's sword glow brightly as the yellow regions at the lower right. no longer operational, iras used a telescope cooled by liquid helium to detect celestial infrared radiation. authors & editors : nasa technical rep. : jay norris. specific rights apply. a service of : lhea at nasa / gsfc & : michigan tech. u.
