marlin, blue â€“ hawaii blue marlin is a large pelagic species, found globally in both tropical and temperate waters. blue marlin mature early, produce many eggs, and grow fast, reaching sizes up to 450 cm and 900 kg. they are caught commercially throughout the pacific ocean and are considered to comprise a single, ocean - wide population. the last population assessment for blue marlin in the pacific indicated that abundance levels were moderate, but the assessment has not been updated for over a decade. there is some indication that blue marlin abundance around hawaii may be declining. this species is primarily captured with pelagic longlines, which result in minimal habitat damage and moderate bycatch rates. around hawaii, trolling is another common method used to catch blue marlin. regulations for pelagic fisheries that capture blue marlin are set at both the international and national level, and include measures to effectively reduce fishery interactions with protected seabirds and sea turtles. this fish may have high levels of mercury that could pose a health risk to adults and children. more mercury info here.
