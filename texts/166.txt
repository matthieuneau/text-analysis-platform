hydrocele operation : aka hydroceles, hydrocele sac, swollen testicle, hydrocelectomy what is it? hydrocele operations or hydrocele surgery is to release fluid that forms in a sac within the scrotum. typically hydroceles develop when the testicle passes into the scrotum but the passage through which this occur fails to close properly. fluid can accumulate in this passage from the abdomen, and then enters the scrotum causing it to swell. this can cause one or both sides of the scrotum to swell and the testicle itself to swell or become damage and inflamed. fluid can also block the tube where sperm typically flow from. hydroceles are more common in newborn boys but are not exclusive to newborn boys. to diagnose a hydrocele typically a doctor will look for swelling in the scrotum caused primarily by fluid build up or will look for something solid like a fluid - filled sac in the scrotum. typically fluid is removed from the hydrocele sac during a procedure called a hydrocelectomy. for the most part this is a straightforward and uncomplicated procedure that may produce a moderate amount of soreness for a few days following the procedure. the long - term benefits far outweigh any short - term soreness. many times the patient is a young patient under the age of 10 or in many cases a newborn baby that is born with a hydrocele defect. usually a surgery takes placed under general anesthesia. a surgeon will make a small incision in the scrotum that will allow fluid to be drained from the scrotum and then seal the passage from the scrotum to the abdomen
