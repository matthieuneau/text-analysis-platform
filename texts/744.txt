glomaxÂ® - multi jr method for dna quantitation using hoechst 33258 - comments & ratings quantitation of dna is an important step for many practices in molecular biology. common techniques that use dna, such as sequencing, cdna synthesis and cloning, rna transcription, transfection, nucleic acid labeling ( e. g., random prime labeling ), etc., all benefit from a defined template concentration. failure to produce results from these techniques sometimes can be attributed to an incorrect estimate of the dna template used. the concentration of a nucleic acid most commonly is measured by uv absorbance at 260nm ( a260 ). absorbance methods are limited in sensitivity, however, due to a high level of background interference.
