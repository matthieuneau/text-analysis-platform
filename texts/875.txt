people who struggle to find enough food to eat are poor. the world bank ’ s poverty line is an income of less than $ 1. 25 a day. financial times readers, who spend more than that amount on their morning newspaper, are in no position to dispute that judgment. in the past two decades, economic growth in china and india has reduced global poverty by an unprecedented amount. that achievement is not diminished because some individuals in both these countries have become very rich. fundamentally, poverty is about absolute deprivation. kay observes that there is also a relative definition of poverty : under the definition that i have proposed on this blog for wealth, poverty would simply be an absence of wealth, or a deficit of valued outcomes. the median income is the level that equal numbers of people are above and below, so that a rise in sir martin sorrell ’ s bonus does not lead anyone into poverty – that would confuse poverty and inequality. but the choice of median income as a reference level has a wider significance. it encapsulates the idea that in a rich society, poverty is an enforced inability to participate in the everyday activities of that society. you might therefore be poor if you lack access to antibiotics or facebook, even though in this respect you are no worse off than the sun king or john d. rockefeller, and in other respects considerably better off than most people in the world. however, to define poverty as social exclusion takes the definition far away from the assessment of income. it is not hard to imagine places in which few, if any, people experience a sense of exclusion. these might include both sophisticated societies with high incomes per head – towns in scandinavia – and simple cultures without access to modern essentials – rural villages in the developing world
