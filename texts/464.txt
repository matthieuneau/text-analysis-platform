for the first time since 1415, we are going to have a conclave or papal election with no pope to bury beforehand. but the procedures for the election are not affected by this ‘ novelty. ’ dan brown might seem an unlikely source for information on a papal election but the detailed description in angels and demons was apparently taken from a book by a jesuit scholar and is quite accurate. when the see of rome is declared vacant – normally when a pope dies – most of the senior prelates who were the pope ’ s ‘ ministers ’ resign. power is entrusted to a cardinal called the camerlengo, in this case cardinal tarcisio bertone, who under normal circumstances would bury the pope. the last papal election took 48 hours, but such speed wasn ’ t always the case. in the 13th century the papacy was vacant for a year - and - a - half and an election was forced by the people of rome who locked up the cardinals until a pope was elected. in another case, the people not only locked up the cardinals, they tore off the roof of the building and put the cardinals on a diet of bread and water. now, with benedict ’ s resignation the cardinals are essentially being given a ‘ month ’ s notice ’ and can plan their trip to rome and think about what they want in the new pope. in a sense, because of the pre - planning that can be brought to bear on this election, there is potentially a lot of time to consider who should be the next leader of the world ’ s 1 billion catholics. the cardinals will stay in a specially constructed 5 storey residence inside the vatican walls, santa marta. and will be conveyed by coach to the sistine chapel for morning and afternoon sessions there.
