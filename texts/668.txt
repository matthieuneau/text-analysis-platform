world bulletin / news desk wheat experts are stepping up monitoring of a crop disease first found in africa in 1999 to minimise the spread of a deadly fungus that is also a threat in asia, experts said on friday. a " rust - tracker ", using data supplied by farmers and scientists, could now monitor the fungus in 27 developing nations across 42 million hectares ( 103 million acres ) of wheat - an area the size of iraq or california. " it's the most serious wheat disease, " ronnie coffman, vice - chair of the borlaug global rust initiative ( bgri ), told reuters ahead of a meeting of wheat experts in beijing from sept. 1 - 4. " if it gets started... it's like a biological firestorm, " he said. experts will review progress in combating the disease, with fungicides and 20 new resistant varieties developed in recent years. the stem rust disease, forming reddish patches on plants like rust on metal, is known as ug99 after it was found in uganda in 1999. it has since spread as far as south africa and north to yemen and iran. the fungus, which can destroy entire wheat fields, is likely eventually to be carried worldwide on the winds. the biggest threat in coming years is a spread across asia to pakistan, india and china, the world's top producer, coffman said. " effective control often depends on finding out what is happening in distant regions, and the rust - tracker can help scientists assess the status of stem rust and other rust diseases, " said dave hodson, the developer of rust - tracker. about 85 percent of wheat now in production worldwide was reckoned to be vulnerable to ug
