politically incorrect? what does this mean? definitions can include something that is potentially offensive to a particular group of people or disregarding political correctness. should elected officals be held to at least an equal if not higher standard? this is my story. it began in a crowded room at a political event this past week. it started as a civil conversation. i asked an elected offical, " what items can be voted on by paper ballot? it sure seems like that would not be a form of transparent, representative government. " that discussion struck a nerve with the elected official. it seemed like hell unleashed its fury on me that night. " f " bombs spewed from the elected official's mouth like ash and flames spew from a volcano. feeling offended, i asked the volcano to quit spewing its fury. only after a second elected official enouraged the volcano to stop, did the " f " bombs cease. if my objective question illicits that type of response, it begs the larger question of this elected official's integrity and respect for common sense and decency.
