12. june 2012 10 : 55 retinal hemorrhage occurs when the blood vessels in the retina get damaged or ruptured, leading to abnormal bleeding. the retina, which is composed of rods and cones is the region of the eye responsible for sensitivity to light, and vision. the retinal vein and artery, along with a dense network of capillaries, are responsible for transmitting the blood supply to the retina. when these blood vessels are damaged, due to any reason, this affects the blood supply to the retina, which in turn leads to a decrease in visual acuity. diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in people aged between 20 and 65. the dense network of cells in the retina is extremely sensitive, and can be damaged with even a slight trauma. the causes due to which this damage might occur include : - high blood pressure - forceful blows in the head region - child abuse in infants - improper development of blood vessels in infants born prematurely - blurred vision - spotted vision - lines in the field of vision - blind spots - distorted vision - progressive vision loss - the disease is diagnosed by an ophthalmologist, who uses an opthalmoscope to examine the internal structure of the eye. - another method that is commonly used to detect the abnormalities in the blood vessels is a fluorescein angiography test, in which a fluorescent dye is injected into the patient â€™ s bloodstream, after which photographs are clicked to view the blood vessels. - in some cases, the physician might also order for a blood test to be performed. - the disorder is self - limiting in most patients, with more than 85 % cases healing on their own.
