vanilla is a product of lussumo : documentation and support. 1 to 16 of 16 this year ’ s nobel prize in medicine went to a trio of scientists who discovered the enzyme telomerase, which allows cells to divide without any limits, making them effectively immortal. it may be nature ’ s greatest double - edged sword. coax cells into producing telomerase, and they will survive indefinitely, but they will also become cancerous. “ in the absence of a comprehensive understanding, it ’ s very dangerous, ” muller said. “ we have to figure out how to do maintenance on our telomeres. ” muller thinks humans could live for 90 to 210 years once scientists know more about the molecular basis of aging. “ if we could figure out how to do maintenance, we could extend our lives, ” he said. “ but it has to be done very carefully, and we ’ d have to have a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism. ” it really does my heart good to know that i'm part of one of the last generations to not live forever.
