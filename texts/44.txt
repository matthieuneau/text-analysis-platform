the tragic loss of one of america ’ s greatest heros, a title he tried to avoid, has saddened the scientific community, the country and the world. his work is not done, however, as neil armstrong is continuing to help demonstrate nasa ‘ s accomplishments. his death has helped to rekindle the effort to declare the lunar landing sites national historic sites, and to highlight the importance of the artifacts left there. with new trips to the moon being planned, it is hoped that disallowing interference in the apollo sites will preserve the history that lies therein. for more information on the work being done on lunar landing site preservation, please see : for the guidelines for preservation established earlier this year, please see : building the world blog by kathleen lusk brooke and zoe g quinn is licensed under a creative commons attribution - noncommercial - noderivs 3. 0 unported license.
