php, while originally designed and built to run on unix, has had the ability since version 3 to run on windows. that includes 9x, me, nt, and 2000. in this article i'm going to go through the process of installing php on windows and explain what you should look out for. on windows, as on unix, you have two options for installing php : as a cgi or as an isapi module. the obvious benefit of the latter is speed. the downside is that this is still somewhat new and may not be as stable. but, before you do anything, you have to do some prep work, which is pretty simple. once you've downloaded and unzipped the windows binary version of php, you have to copy php4isapi. dll from the sapi / directory to winnt / system or windows / system directories. you'll also probably want to move php. ini - dist from your installation directory to the windows / directory and rename it to php. ini, if you plan on changing any of the precompiled defaults. now you're ready to go, regardless of whether you use php as a cgi or isapi module. for nt / 2000, you'll need to tell iis how to recognize php. thanks to the wonders of gui, this can easily be accomplished with a few mouse clicks. first, fire up the microsoft management console or internet service manager, depending on whether you're using nt or 2000. click on the properties button of the web node you'll be working with. in this example we'll use default web server. click the isapi filters tab and then click add
