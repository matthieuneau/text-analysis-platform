forcing yourself to look at the big picture, or pretending that you are a fly on the wall observing a scene as it unfolds, can be an effective anger management strategy. experts say that changing the focus from being a participant in a stressful situation, to being an observer from a distanced perspective can help an individual come to a true understanding of their feelings. researchers call this strategy “ self - distancing. ” in a new study, college students who believed a lab partner was berating them for not following directions responded less aggressively and showed less anger when they were told to take analyze their feelings from a self - distanced perspective. “ the secret is to not get immersed in your own anger and, instead, have a more detached view, ” said dominik mischkowski, lead author of the research performed at ohio state university. “ you have to see yourself in this stressful situation as a fly on the wall would see it. ” while other studies have examined the value of self - distancing for calming angry feelings, this is the first to show that it can work in the heat of the moment, when people are most likely to act aggressively, mischkowski said. the worst thing to do in an anger - inducing situation is what people normally do : try to focus on their hurt and angry feelings to understand them, said brad bushman, ph. d., a co - author of the study. “ if you focus too much on how you ’ re feeling, it usually backfires, ” bushman said. “ it keeps the aggressive thoughts and feelings active in your mind, which makes it more likely that you ’ ll act aggressively. ” study findings are found online in the journal
