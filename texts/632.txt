as the fukushima world disaster continues to unfold, we have learned that the strontium levels are 240 times over the legal limit near the plant, which has become an uninhabitable land area. the nuclear waste advisor to the japanese government recently explained that roughly 966 square kilometers ( km ), or 600 square miles, around fukushima are now uninhabitable due to the unfolding disaster. this massive dead zone area is equivalent in size to 17 manhattan islands placed next to one another. unfortunately, the latest readings taken approximately 20 miles out to sea from the site showed radioisotope levels from all the radioactive particles were ten times higher than those measured in the baltic and black seas after the massive chernobyl disaster. " given that the fukushima plant is on the ocean, and with leaks and runoff directly to the ocean, the impacts on the ocean will exceed those of chernobyl, which was hundreds of miles from any sea, " said ken buessler, senior scientist in marine chemistry at the woods hole oceanographic institution in massachusetts, several months back. it has also been revealed that reactors 1, 2, and 3 have all experienced " melt - throughs. " this means the radiation materials have burnt through and gone directly into the ground and water. this is considered to be the worst possible scenario in a disaster of this nature. " dangerous levels of radioactive iodine and cesium have already contaminated the sea, the soil, groundwater, and the air, " said reporter mark willacy of the australian broadcast corporation in a recent lateline interview. " this week plutonium was detected for the first time outside the stricken plant, and strontium - 90, known as a â€˜
