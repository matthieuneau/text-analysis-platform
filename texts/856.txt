italian government scientists have claimed to have discovered evidence that a supernatural event formed the image on the turin shroud, believed by many to be the burial cloth of jesus christ. after years of work trying to replicate the colouring on the shroud, a similar image has been created by the scientists. however, they only managed the effect by scorching equivalent linen material with high - intensity ultra violet lasers, undermining the arguments of other research, they say, which claims the turin shroud is a medieval hoax. such technology, say researchers from the national agency for new technologies, energy and sustainable economic development ( enea ), was far beyond the capability of medieval forgers, whom most experts have credited with making the famous relic. keyboard shortcuts : v vote up article j next comment k previous comment
