the scientific world is abuzz with news of the ratification of the existence of the subatomic particle called the higgs boson - or more colloquially, the'god particle.'this subatomic particle's existence - which was verified recently ( with virtually near certainty ) by experiments at the large hadron collider in switzerland - lends credence to several long - standing physical theories such as the so - called standard model and the big bang theory. the nickname god particle is ironic for two reasons. first, generally, the nuclear physicists who deal with these matters - postulating the fundamental physical laws of the universe and then setting about to either verify or refute them - tend not to be regular church - goers. while there are some highly prominent scientists who balance personal, religious beliefs with professional, scientific quests, most probably go along with the thoughts of the world - famous physicist, stephen hawking : i regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. there is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers ; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark. [ interview in the guardian, 7 / 9 / 12 ] spontaneous creation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universe exists, why we exist. it is not necessary to invoke god... [ from his book ; the grand design, 2010 ] so it is a bit ironic that physics'most famous quest has resulted in the discovery of the'god particle.'most physicists are quite comfortable having their names associated with famous - even if dead - humans like newton, einstein or the afore - mentioned hawking. one will find few, if any, attri
