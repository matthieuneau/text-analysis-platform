on january 16, 1863, walt whitman wrote a pained letter to his brother, thomas jefferson whitman, in which he bemoaned the union ’ s recent defeat at fredericksburg as the most “ complete piece of mismanagement perhaps ever yet known in the earth's wars. ” while whitman today is celebrated as one of america ’ s greatest poets, works like leaves of grass, penned in the 1850s, were seen as scandalous by an american reading public unready for whitman ’ s unconventional lifestyle. an opponent of slavery, whitman supported the union with the poem beat! beat! drums and volunteered as a nurse in army hospitals. after lincoln ’ s assassination in 1865, whitman penned oh captain, my captain, eulogizing the president for having navigated the ship of state through the storm of war, only to meet a violent end.
