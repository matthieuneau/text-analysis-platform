idaho state university researchers study newly discovered earthquake fault in idaho ’ s sawtooth mountains posted september 28, 2010 while looking at a highly detailed new topographic image of idaho ’ s sawtooth range, idaho state university geosciences professor glenn thackray had an " eureka moment " when he discovered a previously unknown active earthquake fault about 65 miles, as the crow flies, from boise. the researchers examined a light detection and ranging ( lidar ) image. lidar is a remote sensing system used to collect topographic data with aircraft - mounted lasers capable of recording elevation measurements at a rate of 25, 000 pulses per second and can have a vertical precision of about six inches. the images can be displayed so they don't show an area's vegetation. four years ago while doing some research on glaciers in the sawtooth range, thackray was examining a high - resolution, " bare - earth " lidar image of the mountains : this is when he noticed a line running through the image in the vicinity of redfish lake. " the black line stood out and i thought that it had to be an earthquake fault, " thackray said. " it was long suspected that there was an active fault in the sawtooths, but without the lidar technology it would have been exceptionally hard to find. " since that time, isu researchers have been on the ground documenting the fault that is at least 25 miles long and could be as long as 40 miles. it is located on the eastern edge of the range and comes within about five miles from the town of stanley. a portion of it runs through the upper end of redfish lake. it runs along the range approximately from near stanley lake to at least as far south as
