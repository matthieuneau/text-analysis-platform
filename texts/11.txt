octodon degus is generally considered endemic to west central chile, where it inhabits the lower slopes of the andes. although some have argued that its range may extend north into peru, this is not well supported. it is common in the international pet trade, however, and is often used in laboratory studies outside of its native range. ( contreras, et al., 1987 ; woods and boraker, 1975 ) octodon degus inhabits a mediterranean - type semi - arid shrubland ecosystem called " matorral ", which is found on the western slopes of the andes between 28 and 35 degrees south latitude. further north the climate becomes too arid to support this plant community, and further south it is too wet. degus appear to be limited to elevations below 1200 meters, both by the distribution of their habitat and by their intolerance of low oxygen partial pressure. degus are well able to inhabit lands influenced by cattle grazing, and are agricultural pests in some areas. ( contreras, et al., 1987 ; fulk, 1976 ) octodon degus superficially resembles a gerbil, but is much larger. degus typically weigh between 170 and 300 g, and measure between 325 and 440 mm in length, including the tail. the fur is yellow - brown on the back and head, and the underparts and feet are cream colored. there is a pale band around the eye and, in some individuals, the neck. the tail is moderately long and conspicuously tufted. the ears are large and darkly pigmented. the fifth digit is reduced, and on the forefeet it has a nail instead of a claw. the cheekteeth are hypsodont
