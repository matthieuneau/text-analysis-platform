a 2012 survey conducted by the association for pet obesity prevention found 52. 5 percent of dogs and 58. 3 percent of cats to be overweight or obese by their veterinarian. this translates to nearly 80 million dogs and cats in america with a weight problem. dr. george banta, chair of the veterinary technology department at brown mackie college - akron and dr. mary jo wagner, attending veterinarian at argosy university, twin cities, offer useful information for pet owners. how can you tell if your pet is overweight? “ it ’ s not the number of pounds, it ’ s how the animal carries the weight, ” says banta. “ the number on the body condition score is more important than pounds. ” the body condition score offers a way to assess the condition of an animal, usually on a scale from one to five, taking into account height, weight, and relative proportions of muscle and fat. with a little knowledge, you can use sight and touch to figure your pet ’ s general condition. “ when looking down on a dog or cat from above, ” says banta, “ the body should slim to a discernable waist. an animal is too thin if you can see the spine or ribs ; however, you should be able to feel them beneath the fur. ” an animal of ideal weight will also display a pelvic tuck when viewed from the side. “ just like humans, when animals overeat, they face increased risk for health problems like diabetes, heart disease, gastrointestinal problems and cancer, ” continues banta. in fact, these risks also include a shortened life expectancy. many owners feed pets according to the manufacturer ’ s suggested amounts
