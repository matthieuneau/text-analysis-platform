this is the time of year gulf coast residents begin watching the weather reports to see if there is a storm and if it is heading their way. it would be wise if we watched, as well. and prepared accordingly. think back to october 1995, when hurricane opal hit the florida panhandle. it remained a hurricane for the next 12 hours as it roared deep into alabama. fifty mph winds were felt as far north as montgomery. anniston got more than six inches of rain in a few hours. power outages erupted throughout the state. the system spun off tornadoes and caused extensive damage all the way to tennessee. more recently, hurricane ivan, which made landfall near gulf shores in september 2004, sent the wind gusting at more than 60 mph in central alabama and caused more power outages, more tornados and more rain. now ernesto is taking aim at the gulf coast. although alabama is not currently in the cone of uncertainty, anyone who follows the weather knows hurricanes can change course. our ability to predict where and when a storm will strike improves every year, but it is still an imperfect science. however, this much we do know : it is better to be prepared, just in case. when serious weather looms, make sure you have working flashlights and a weather radio with plenty of batteries. keep your cell phones charged, keep gas in your car, and if you have a freezer, and there is room in it, pack in a couple of bags of ice, the most valuable commodity when the power goes out. some bottled water and non - perishable food would be wise â€” and an old fashioned can - opener, the kind that does not need electricity. you can figure out the rest.
