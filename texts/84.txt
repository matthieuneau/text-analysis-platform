fewer rare sea turtles will die on the swordfish industry's longlines in hawaii under an agreement between environmental groups and the government. the agreement settles a lawsuit challenging the federal government's plans that would have dramatically increase the number of turtles that could be killed. the turtle island restoration network, center for biological diversity and kahea sued the national marine fisheries service for allowing 46 imperiled pacific loggerhead turtles to be hooked last year. the new court - ordered settlement caps the number at 17 per year. meanwhile the national marine fisheries service is weighing whether loggerheads need more protection under the endangered species act. " it made absolutely no sense to have one arm of the national marine fisheries service increasing the lethal capture of loggerheads, while the other arm is in the process of determining whether loggerheads should be uplisted from threatened to endangered, " said todd steiner, biologist and executive director of turtle island restoration network. " with extinction looming, these animals need more protection, not less. " " with this decision, hawaii's public - trust ocean resources can be better managed for our collective best interest, and not just the interests of this commercial fishery, " said kahea program director marti townsend. " this is a victory not just for the turtles, but for hawaii's people who rely on a healthy, functioning ocean ecosystem. " conservation groups represented by earthjustice filed a federal lawsuit challenging a 2009 rule allowing the swordfish fleet to catch nearly three times as many loggerhead sea turtles as previously permitted. this settlement freezes the number at the previous cap of 17 while the government conducts additional environmental studies and decides whether or not to classify the loggerhead as endangered, rather than its current,
