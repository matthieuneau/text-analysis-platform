- our story - in memory vaccination and immunotherapy for alzheimer ’ s disease vaccination against amyloid is a promising approach for the development of alzheimer ’ s disease ( ad ) therapeutics. approximately half of the investigational new therapeutics in human clinical trials for ad are active or passive immunotherapeutics. active vaccination involves the injection of an antigen and relies on the production of antibodies in the vaccinated patient. four human clinical trials of active vaccination currently are under way. passive immunization is also a promising strategy that involves the production of antibodies outside of the patient and injection of these antibodies. there are currently 12 clinical trials of passive immunization. you can check for alzheimer therapeutics in human clinical trials by visiting www. clinicaltrials. gov and searching for key words “ alzheimer ’ s and immunotherapy. ” thinking out of the box the development of vaccinations as a strategy for treating or preventing alzheimer ’ s is an example of thinking out of the box. vaccinations commonly are associated with infectious diseases, like influenza, small pox and polio, which appear to have little in common with neurodegenerative diseases, like alzheimer ’ s. moreover, the brain is an immunoprivileged site with little access to antibodies, so it seems unlikely antibodies would be protective in the brain. researchers were pleasantly surprised when dale schenk and co - workers at elan inc. reported that vaccination of transgenic mouse models of ad against the amyloid aß peptide prevented amyloid deposition in young animals and removed pre - existing amyloid deposits in older animals. subsequent work showed that
