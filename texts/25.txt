" got nothing but blue skies " it is september 19, 1783. the place, lyons, france. preparations are being made for a journey. a journey that will eventually take man from his secure environment of terra firma, and place him in a hostile environment called the atmosphere. the vehicle to be used is a hot air balloon. the brainchild behind this trek is a wealthy paper maker named joseph montgolfier. there has been much speculation over just how montgolfier made the discovery of the hot air balloon. the most commonly - believed story is that his wife was standing too close to a fire and that the smoke caused her skirt to be inflated and lifted above her knees. this caused montgolfier to wonder - if this smoke, and its magical lifting powers, could be captured in a very large container, it might rise and lift a passenger along with it. so, montgolfier went about building the first hot air balloon. in 1783, not much was known about the atmosphere and its effects on human beings. upon examination of the occupants for any ill effects caused by this lofty height, it was discovered that the duck had a broken wing. could this have been an effect of exposure to altitude? actually, several observers noted that as the balloon left the ground, the sheep had an anxiety attack and kicked the duck. montgolfier reasoned that it would be safe for humans to ascend to altitude. so on november 21, 1783, jean francois pilatre de rozier ( a surgeon ) became the first aeronaut and flight surgeon. over 200 years have passed since that first flight. technology has allowed us to ascend through the atmosphere and into space, but the hazards of high altitude
