i like projects. i really liked this project. the pipe insulation roller coaster project is one of the most enjoyable projects i've ever used in class. it was my second year teaching physics. during the unit on energy, the book we were using frequently used roller coasters in their problems. we even had a little " roller coaster " to use with photo gates. i thought we could do better. my original idea was to get some flexible hot wheels tracks and make some loop - de - loops and hills. turns out a class set of hot wheels track is pretty expensive. on an unrelated yet serendipitous visit to my local big box hardware store, i ran across the perfect ( and cheap! ) substitute : pipe insulation!. for $ 1. 30 or so you can get six feet of pipe insulation - which doubles nicely as a marble track1 when you split the pipe insulation into two equal halves. it's really easy to cut pipe insulation with a sharp pair of scissors. just be sure you don't buy the " self - sealing " pipe insulation, which has glue pre - applied - it's more expensive and it'd turn into a sticky mess. at first i planning to simply design a one - period long investigation using the pipe insulation ( my original ideas morphed into the pre - activity for this project ). as i started to think through the project more and more, i realized we could go way bigger. and thus, the pipe insulation roller coaster project was born. building the coasters in groups of three, students were given 24 feet of pipe insulation ( 4 pieces ), a roll of duct tape2, and access to a large pile of cardboard boxes3. all groups
