nuclear energy in france nuclear energy is the cornerstone of french energy policy. in the â€˜ 70s france chose to develop nuclear as its base load electricity source as a response to the oil crisis and assure its energy independence. nuclear electricity production : france currently counts 58 commercial nuclear reactors in operation responsible for producing 80 % of french domestic electricity. as a comparison, the 104 us reactors produces 20 % of us electricity. despite scarce natural resources, france has reached an energy independence of 50 % thanks to its strategic choice for nuclear energy. environment : as well as providing safe and reliable energy, nuclear helps to reduce french greenhouse gas emissions by avoiding the release of 31 billions tones of carbon dioxide ( contrary to coal or gas generation ) and making france the less carbon emitting country within the oecd. as a leader in nuclear energy, france has developed clean technology for radioactive waste disposal. reprocessing currently allows france to recover valuable elements from spent fuels and permit a significant reduction of high level waste and lead to safer and optimized containment, for final radioactive waste disposition. french nuclear power plants produces only 10 g / year / inhabitant of highly radioactive waste. international cooperation and research : france is one of the forerunner in nuclear research and participates in numerous international cooperation programs alongside the united states such as the development of the next generation of nuclear power plants ( gen iv ) and the international thermonuclear experimental reactor ( iter ) that will be built in cadarache, south of france. the french atomic energy commission ( cea ) the french atomic energy commission is a public body established in october 1945 by general de gaulle. it constitutes a power of expertise and proposition for the authorities. a leader in research, development and innovation, the
