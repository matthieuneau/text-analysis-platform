gef and unep launch global platform for efficient lighting 25 september 2009 : the global environment facility ( gef ) and the united nations environment programme ( unep ) have launched the “ global market transformation for efficient lighting platform, ” a public - private partnership directed at reducing global energy demand for lighting. the platform aims to transform lighting markets, primarily in developing countries, by fostering the usage and production of energy efficient lighting while gradually discontinuing use of incandescent lighting, and substituting traditional fuel - based lighting with modern, efficient alternatives such as solid - state lighting ( ssl ) and light emitting diode ( led ) lamps. it is hoped that, through these efforts, global demand for lighting energy can eventually be reduced by up to 18 percent. in attendance for the event was unep executive director achim steiner, who noted that “ in terms of climate change, this is among the lowest of low - hanging fruit. eight percent of global greenhouse gas emissions are linked with lighting ; this project can by 2014 make a big dent in these while saving people money too. ” [ un news centre ] [ gef press release ]
