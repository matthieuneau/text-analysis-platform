breast cancer represents one of the most common cancers among women in the united states. data indicates that more than 180, 000 american women received a diagnosis of breast cancer in 2009. the various risk factors include : the female gender, heredity, genetic factors, aging and idiopathic causes. what you should know about breast cancer the short answer to what you should know about breast cancer is that it ’ s a malignant tumor in the breast tissue. with non - invasive breast cancer, the tumor stays localized and does not spread ( metastasize ) from its origin of growth. experts refer to this as “ carcinoma in situ ”. the tumor occurs in and remains confined to the ducts ( ductal carcinoma in situ ) or confined to the lobules ( lobular carcinoma in situ ). “ duct ” and “ lobules ” refer to the milk duct and the milk producing glands, respectively, in the mammary glands. most breast cancers start in the ducts and spread to other tissues. lobular carcinoma doesn ’ t meet the criteria of a true cancer by itself, but is a marker for many other types of cancer – both invasive and non - invasive. an invasive tumor spreads beyond its area of origin and can have three different stages of invasiveness – localized, regional and distant stages. as the names suggest localized types include those which remain localized to the breast tissues, the regional stage refers to the spread of the tumor to the tissues surrounding the breast ( e. g. – lymph nodes ) and the distant tumors are those that spread away from the breast to other tissues and organs. needless to mention, patients with distant tumors are not easily managed. about
