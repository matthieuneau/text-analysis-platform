in digital imaging, there are 256 levels, or tonal values, ranging from black to white. black is level 0. white is level 255. of course, not all images ( e. g. extreme foggy, misty, atmospheric shots ) contain the full tonal range from black to white, but most do. the histogram ( levels ) is a graphical representation of the tonal values in an image. ideally, it should range from 0 to 255, with a good spread of tonal values throughout. if the histogram is bunched up towards the left, it indicates the image is under - exposed. note the crushed shadow detail. if bunched up towards the right, it's over exposed. note the blown - out highlights. if the black and white points are set incorrectly, the image will have a dull, flat, washed - out appearance. here they're wrongly set to 20 / 230. unless under instructions from a repro bureau or printer, you should not set the black / white points to anything other than 0 / 255. the printer may well adjust them later for technical reasons to do with repro, but don't try to guess what's required. it's true that some leeway is acceptable ( e. g. up to 5 % is usually ok ), but your images will lack visual impact if the black / white points are incorrect, so don't do this as a matter of course. in the vast majority of cases, it's best to set them to 0 / 255.
