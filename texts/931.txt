to use kickstart mode, you must first create a kickstart file, and make it available to the red hat linux installation program. normally this is done by copying the kickstart file to the boot diskette, or making it available on the network. the network - based approach is most commonly used, as most kickstart installations tend to be performed on networked computers. this also makes it easier to install red hat linux on many computers, as the kickstart files can be kept on single server system, and read by the individual computers during the installation. let's take a more in - depth look at the locations where kickstart file may be placed. to perform a diskette - based kickstart installation, the kickstart file must be named ks. cfg, and reside in the boot diskette's top - level directory. note that the red hat linux boot diskettes are in ms - dos format, making it easy to copy the kickstart file under linux using the mcopy command ( or, if you insist, you can also use windows ). although there's no technological requirement for it, most diskette - based kickstart installations install red hat linux from cd - rom. network installations using kickstart are quite common, because system administrators can easily automate the installation of many networked computers quickly and painlessly. in general, the approach most commonly used is for the administrator to have both a bootp / dhcp server and an nfs server on the local network. the bootp / dhcp server is used to give the client system its networking information, while the nfs server serves the actual files used during the installation. often
