sri lanka : year in review 2011article free pass in 2011 sri lanka continued to recover from its 26 - year civil war, which had ended in 2009. pres. mahinda rajapakse enjoyed great popularity among the majority sinhalese community for having defeated the tamil tigers ( liberation tigers of tamil eelam ; ltte ). as expected, the united people â€™ s freedom alliance, led by rajapakse, dominated local government elections held in march and july. predominantly tamil areas formerly held by the ltte in the north and east of the country voted for the tamil national alliance. during 2011 the president moved to consolidate political power ( much of it held by members of his family ) in the executive branch of government while placing limits on media freedom, the role of civil society in sri lankan politics, and the expression of antigovernment dissent. in august it was announced that emergency regulations in place for nearly three decades were being lifted, but this still left many powers in government hands and failed to allay fears of repression among some sri lankans. international attention was directed throughout the year toward alleged violations of human rights in sri lanka. a highly critical report submitted to the un human rights council in september charged that both the ltte and government forces deliberately targeted civilians during the civil war. the government refused to permit an international investigation into human rights violations in sri lanka, and in october it announced the creation of a national action plan designed to protect and promote human rights and support reconciliation between the communities. former general sarath fonseka, who had commanded the sri lankan army in its victory over the tamil tigers and later had become a political rival of rajapakse, was sentenced to three years in prison for
