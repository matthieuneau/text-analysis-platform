the savannah river site is likely a prime contender for storing spent nuclear fuel for decades to come, according to a report released thursday. the study by robert alvarez, a former senior adviser at the department of energy and professor at johns hopkins university, outlines the possible impact of making srs an interim storage site for the country ’ s commercial nuclear power plant waste. recently formed environmental group don ’ t waste aiken commissioned alvarez, an expert on nuclear waste with washington, d. c., think tank the policy institute, to produce a study outlining the impact of storing spent nuclear fuel at srs. speaking at a press conference announcing his findings, alvarez outlined the amount of radioactivity spent fuel could bring – more than double the radioactivity present at srs currently in high - level waste could be delivered. high level liquid waste tanks at srs have near 280 million curies of radioactivity. spent fuel looking to be stored could bring 1 billion curies to the doe - owned site. “ this would be one of the largest concentrations of radioactivity in the united states in one place ” alvarez said. “ i ’ m not questioning the ability of the people at savannah river to handle this material. i ’ m really trying to give people an idea of what the implications are. ” the report also said some 2, 500 shipments of high - level waste initially could travel across the nation ’ s highways for storage at srs if sent by truck ; however, alvarez noted that he thought a single repository was unlikely and impractical. alvarez ’ report will be officially released thursday as discussion intensifies over how to deal with the nation ’ s growing amount of commercial power plant waste. the nation today has about 70,
