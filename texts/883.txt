assessing students'understanding of complex systems assessing student understanding of complex thinking is quite challenging. as with assessing student learning on any topic, the first step is to identify your learning goals for your students. once you have identified learning goals, it becomes easier to choose one or more assessment tools appropriate to the task. here is a list of possible learning objectives related to students'thinking about complex systems ( i. e., skills expected from students who exhibit complex systems thinking ). while this is in no way intended to be a comprehensive list of possible learning goals, it may help you to articulate your own list. a student who demonstrates complex systems thinking can : - identify and explain the characteristics of a complex system - describe and / or model a process where there is a feedback mechanism at work - build a model that mimics the expected behavior of the target system - identify stocks / reservoirs and flows - correctly identify positive / negative feedbacks - test a model through trial and error and comparison to real - world data - explore the possible outcomes of a system under different parameters - bridge across scales : student explanations of processes show fidelity across scales ( e. g., a student applies the concept of homeostasis at multiple levels ) - create and interpret graphical information - predict attributes of system behavior based on specific inputs or components of the system - understand that a complex system is irreducible, unpredictable, historical, nonlinear, and has emergent properties, and be able to describe what these terms mean a number of assessment tools can be used to assess students'understanding ( or progress toward understanding ) of complex systems. a few of these tools are listed below. a concept map is a diagram with hierarchical nodes, labeled with concepts. the nodes are linked together
