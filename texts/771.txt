old name for the middle east ern area which is now israel, supposedly derived from " philistine, " a biblical - era name for a part of the region. in 1948 a united nations mandate divided the area between arabs and jews - - the palestinian leaders and leaders of surrounding countries ( who were all arabs ) did not accept this and have several times since then invaded or attacked israeli territory. in the process of fighting back, israel actually gained about 80 % of the territory originally divided about equally between the two groups. the gaza strip and the west bank are some of these areas ; they are now partially ruled by the palestinians native to the areas but are still overall under israeli control. many palestinians, both those who've left the area and those who've stayed, are part of resistance movements with the goal of regaining some or all of the territory once called palestine back from israel.
