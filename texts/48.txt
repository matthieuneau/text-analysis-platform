angola is a giant jigsaw puzzle of different climates, landscapes, cultures and colors. from mountains to vast open plains, wide white beaches to thick tropical rainforest, angola has it all, as if each of its eighteen provinces were a different country. lubango has a mild temperate climate, luanda is hot and dry, while cabinda is steamy and tropical. much of the landscape is dramatic, with plunging waterfalls, bizarre rock formations and deep gorges. with an atlantic coastline stretching for over 1. 650 kms, angola has mighty rivers flowing into wide estuaries depositing sediments from the high plateaus to form numerous small islands, bays and sandbanks. in angola, you can encounter a diversity of wild animals : lions, hyenas, elephants and antelopes. apes, hippopotamuses and crocodiles are also indigenous to this country. in the namib desert, which is situated in the south - west, you can find the tumboa, a unique plant with two wide leaves that are several metres long and lie on the ground of the desert. although the climate is such that the beaches can be visited all year round, it is in fact during the hot season that they are most frequented. the bars all filled and the local music and dancing provide an animated and exotic atmosphere that mixes well with the mystery of the african nights.
