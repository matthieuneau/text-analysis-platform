my passion is studying early man, specifically how we became who we are. is our violence an aberration or part and parcel of survival? no other mammal kills their own, but maybe – as the alpha on the planet – our greatest threat to our survival is our own species, so we ’ re forced to destroy each other. what was lacking in h. habilis that led to their extinction, to be replaced by the big - brained, scrawny homo erectus? habilis was preyed upon by species with bigger claws, sharper teeth and thicker skin. habilis ( and my friend lyta ) scavenged their left - overs, in between hiding from the imposing mammals that dominated the plio - pleistocene african savanna. but, eventually hiding wasn ’ t enough and h. erectus took over ( we don ’ t know if they fought with each other or if habilis left ‘ with a whimper ’ ). h. erectus, with his longer lower limbs for running and walking efficiency, his bigger brain especially in the areas for planning and forethought ( and speech depending upon whose research you ’ re reading ) was tall, thin, and barrel - chested, hardly daunting in a world of sabertooth cats, mammoth and giant sloths. yet, it is he who spread from africa to china, india, the middle east, java. it is he – not predator cats or alligators – who developed a highly adaptable culture allowing him to survive a wide range of climates and habitats. that is the first of their firsts. want more? - first appearance of systematic hunting. - first use of fire ( though arguably no control of it ) - first indication of
