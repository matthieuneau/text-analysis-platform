outmaneuvering foodborne pathogens at various locations, ars scientists are doing research to make leafy greens and other fresh produce safer for consumers. produce and leafy greens in the photo are ( clockwise from top ) : romaine lettuce, cabbage, cilantro in a bed of broccoli sprouts, spinach and other leafy greens, green onions, tomatoes, and green leaf lettuce. if pathogens like e. coli o157 : h7 or salmonella had a motto for survival, it might be : “ find! bind! multiply! ” that pretty much sums up what these food - poisoning bacteria do in nature, moving through our environment to find a host they can bind to and use as a staging area for multiplying and spreading. but ars food - safety scientists in california are determined to find out how to stop these and other foodborne pathogenic bacteria in their tracks, before the microbes can make their way to leafy greens and other favorite salad ingredients like tomatoes and sprouts. the research is needed to help prevent the pathogens from turning up in fresh produce that we typically eat uncooked. that ’ s according to robert e. mandrell, who leads the ars produce safety and microbiology research unit. his team is based at the agency ’ s western regional research center in albany, california. the team is pulling apart the lives of these microbes to uncover the secrets of their success. it ’ s a complex challenge, in part because the microbes seem to effortlessly switch from one persona to the next. they are perhaps best known as residents of the intestines of warm - blooded animals, including humans. for another role
