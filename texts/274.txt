detailed distribution map information this map reflects the specimen location information from the wisconsin botanical information system database and attemps to line up the original town - range survey map from 1833 to 1866 with a computer generated table grid over the map of wisconsin. because the original town range lines are inexact, these " dots " might be somewhat skewed. also townships near the borders of the state might only be partial, so the " dot " might center outside the state's boundry. holding the mouse over the " dot " identifies the town - range. clicking ( new window ) on the " dot " will link to a list of all specimen accession numbers for this location. you can then link to the individual specimen's label data. arrange this window side - by - side with the specimen - list window so you can easily go back and forth between this map and the specimen's data.
