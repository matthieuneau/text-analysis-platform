by tom boyle all things birds associate naturalist | natco lake was created by accident, rather than by mother nature. the national fireproofing company ( natco ) mined clay here for bricks in the 1930's. eventually the mining equipment hit underground springs and the lake filled in. a ditch was dug in an attempt to drain off the water into a nearby tidal creek. the ditching brought in salt water and made the lake brackish, as it remains today. birding the northern section of the lake : walk east along the henry hudson trail and over a small bridge. eastern phoebe has nested under this bridge. after the bridge, turn right off the paved trail and then left. follow the unpaved trail a short distance to a small tidal cove in the lake. on a changing tide, yellow - crowned night heron is regularly seen. both night herons nest locally and can be seen frequently. occasionally, diamond - backed terrapins are seen basking on flotsam in the cove. continue on the unpaved trail until it ends at a lawn on the lake's north side. scan the lake here. shorebirds can be found in migration, along with herons, osprey, gulls, cormorants, terns, and waterfowl. great black - backed gull has begun nesting on one of the islands in the lake. don't be surprised to see something unusual. an american white pelican was seen on the lake in january about five years ago. i've seen american oystercatcher, black skimmer, and copulating least terns sitting on the island in front of you. this is a good spot to check for lingering waterfowl
