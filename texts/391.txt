when i was learning carpentry from a master carpenter, i tried to do something with a tool close at hand instead of going to get the correct tool for the job. of course, i butchered the piece of wood and eventually had to get the right tool, which got the job done in a fraction of the time that i wasted with the convenient - to - reach tool. the same lesson applies to power quality tools, which range from a simple screwdriver to a $ 24, 000, 32 - gigahertz ( ghz ) spectrum analyzer. not only can you waste time and not get the answer you are looking for, you might even be led to the wrong answer using the wrong tool for the task. before going into the variety of tools available, here ’ s a quick safety reminder. always assess the hazards and skills required for the task, and ensure you or whoever is doing it is a “ qualified person ” per the national electrical code definition. ensure all personnel within the possible hazard area wear the proper personal protective equipment per nfpa 70e and other local requirements. and wherever possible, make connections on de - energized circuits only. even something as simple as taking a panel cover off to tighten a screw can be disastrous. accidents don ’ t always happen to someone else. on the low end of the price range is an item in everyone ’ s tool kit : a digital multimeter ( dmm ). a dmm can measure a number of steady - state power quality phenomena, such as voltage imbalance. it can also be used to find voltage drops across contacts and other devices that should have very low drops. excessive neutral - to - ground voltage is often a steady - state condition
