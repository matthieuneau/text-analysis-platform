a token to the future : a digital ‘ archive ’ of early australian children ’ s literature mallan, kerry m., cross, amy, & allan, cherie ( 2012 ) a token to the future : a digital ‘ archive ’ of early australian children ’ s literature. papers : explorations into children's literature, 22 ( 1 ), pp. 94 - 108. this essay considers a specific digital ‘ archive ’ of early australian children ’ s literature, known as the children ’ s literature digital resources ( cldr ), which is located in austlit : the australian literature resource ( http : / / www. austlit. edu. au ). we examine what the cldr collection can tell us about australia ’ s history. to narrow the scope, we focus on how australia was constructing itself as a nation with its own character, or national identity, in texts written for children from the latter part of the nineteenth century up until the end of world war ii. our approach is to consider how early australian children ’ s literature included in the cldr collection rhetorically constructs nation and place, and in so doing constructs an australian identity for its implied readers. citation countsare sourced monthly fromand citation databases. these databases contain citations from different subsets of available publications and different time periods and thus the citation count from each is usually different. some works are not in either database and no count is displayed. scopus includes citations from articles published in 1996 onwards, and web of science generally from 1980 onwards. citations counts from theindexing service can be viewed at the linked google scholar™ search. full - text downloadsdisplays the total number of times this work ’ s files ( e.
