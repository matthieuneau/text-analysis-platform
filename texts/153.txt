it's normal for parents to disagree and argue from time to time. parents might disagree about money, home chores, or how to spend time. they might disagree about big things — like important decisions they need to make for the family. they might even disagree about little things that don't seem important at all — like what's for dinner or what time someone gets home. sometimes parents can disagree with each other and still manage to talk about it in a calm way, where both people get a chance to listen and to talk. but many times when parents disagree, they argue. an argument is a fight using words. most kids worry when their parents argue. loud voices and angry words parents might use can make kids feel scared, sad, or upset. even arguments that use silence — like when parents act angry and don't talk to each other at all — can be upsetting for kids. if the argument has anything to do with the kids, kids might think they have caused their parents to argue and fight. if kids think it's their fault, they might feel guilty or even more upset. but parents'behavior is never the fault of kids. what does it mean when parents fight? kids often worry about what it means when parents fight. they might jump to conclusions and think arguments mean their parents don't love each other anymore. they might think it means their parents will get a divorce. but parents'arguments usually don't mean that they don't love each other or that they're getting a divorce. most of the time the arguments are just a way to let off steam when parents have a bad day or feel stressed out over other things. most people lose their cool now and then.
