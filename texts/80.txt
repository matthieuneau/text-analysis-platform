there are many ways to effectively teach a dog. not so long ago, most of the accepted methods for training were forceful or aversive. unfortunately, some of these methods still are in use among the abusive and uneducated. one of the pioneers of gentle training techniques was barbara woodhouse. this english dog trainer was instrumental in paving the way for today ’ s nonaversive and positive methods of training. she was a genius at molding behaviors with lures and gently “ modeling ” a dog into positions without force. but even woodhouse used some techniques that can be considered rough by today ’ s standards. if you have researched dog - training methodologies at all, you probably have noticed that a percentage of the available training books advocate the use of a “ choke chain ” ( otherwise called the training collar ). when used properly, this training device relies on aversion to get the dog ’ s attention or to make a correction when your dog doesn ’ t respond to a command correctly. a sharp snap of the leash tightens the collar around the dog ’ s neck, startling the dog with a momentary, low - level pain. the choke chain is not a training device for leash pullers, as is commonly thought, and when used incorrectly can, at the least, cause misalignment of the spine and trachea damage. at worst, it can cause brain damage and even death. because there is such a high risk for misuse of this device ( you may not realize that the choke chain should be worn with the free ring up, for instance ), the training world probably would be much better off without it. your efforts to train your dog should focus on building a bond and nurturing trust.
