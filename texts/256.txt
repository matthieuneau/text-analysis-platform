welcome to bsa troop 51 based out of waterford, mi. please take a look around and have a great day. how scouting started in the united states one day in 1909 in london, england, an american visitor, william d. boyce, lost his way in a dense fog. he stopped under a street lamp and tried to figure out where he was. a boy approached him and asked if he could be of help. you certainly can, said boyce. he told the boy that he wanted to find a certain business office in the center of the city. i ’ ll take you there, said the boy. when they got to the destination, mr. boyce reached into his pocket for a tip. but the boy stopped him. no thank you, sir. i am a scout. i won ’ t take anything for helping. a scout? and what might that be? asked boyce. the boy told the american about himself and about his brother scouts. boyce became very interested. after finishing his errand, he had the boy take him to the british scouting office. at the office, boyce met lord robert baden - powell, the famous british general who had founded the scouting movement in great britain. boyce was so impressed with what he learned that he decided to bring scouting home with him. on february 8, 1910, boyce and a group of outstanding leaders founded the boy scouts of america. from that day forth, scouts have celebrated february 8, as the birthday of scouting in the united states. what happened to the boy who helped mr. boyce find his way in the fog? no one knows. he had neither asked for money nor given his name, but he will never be forgotten.
