if it wasn ’ t for earthquakes, humans wouldn ’ t have innovated architecture they wouldn ’ t have looked into new ways of building homes, but the problem is that we got good at it – good to the points our homes won ’ t be destroyed frequently enough aka they won ’ t evolute frequently. if you look around you, there is very few free space - and in those spots you find big centers being eradicated everyday – safe and resistant enough – specially to earthquakes – what on earth will take down those inefficient dumb primitive beton monsters and make room for better buildings in the future? so the problem behind this is the ever expanding gap between technology and architecture : our homes will always be behind technology / progress – they will be always less optimal. i can only imagine how better the earth will be if our houses were “ smart ” or modern enough – it is not science fiction – the way we build stuff is very retarded to say the least when it comes to the material used, energy saving, what a home can “ do ” and it is just not possible “ business wise ” to say : ok, let us destroy and rebuild. before, nature took care of this, slowly and “ less painfully ” as little earthquakes happened, our primitive cities got “ devastated ”, we rebuilt them in a better way but the costs were small. we kept gradually improving till our cities became resistant to medium / high earthquakes. we reached this point of the graph where things slow down, become stable – it is cool not to have the tragedy and misery of earthquakes, but on the other hand there is the hidden and expensive cost of stability and non - progress. it is invisible and super slow but as
