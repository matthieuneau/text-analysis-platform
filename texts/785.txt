it ’ s a fact. men are better than women … at sweating. yep, we do it more frequently and more effectively. congrats guys. researchers at osaka international university in japan measured the perspiration rates of men and women while they biked for an hour under controlled conditions. the researchers had 37 subjects cycle for an hour at increasing intensities — active subjects had participated in endurance sports for more than six years, while inactive subjects had, for the most part, not performed regular physical activity in the previous three years. the scientists measured the subjects ’ temperature, sweat rate and activated sweat glands for a number of sites on the body, including the forehead and thigh. the information was used to calculate sweat gland output and measure performance. the study revealed that physically fit men sweat more than anyone else. in general, men sweat more than women, and that has its advantages. sweating is how our body cools off. so, by sweating more than women, men are able to exercise for a longer time. ‘ ” it appears that women are at a disadvantage when they need to sweat a lot during exercise, ” said yoshimitsu inoue, the study ’ s coordinator. “ especially in hot conditions. ” previous physical training increased sweating in both men and women, but the increase was greater with men. as the workouts got more intense, the difference in sweating between the sexes increased. interestingly enough, fit women sweat more than unfit men, but by an insignificant margin. the researchers believe that testosterone could explain why men sweat better than women. prior research has shown a link between the male sex - hormone testosterone, physical training and an increase in sweat rate. although they did not measure the hormone among their
