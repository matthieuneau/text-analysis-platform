air massan extensive body of the atmosphere whose physical properties, particularly temperature and humidity, exhibit only small and continuous differences in the horizontal. it may extend over an area of several million square kilometres and over a depth of several kilometres. backing windcounter - clockwise change of wind direction, in either hemisphere. beaufort scalewind force scale, original based on the state of the sea, expressed in numbers from 0 to 12. fetchdistance along a large water surface trajectory over which a wind of almost uniform direction and speed blows. fogsuspension of very small, usually microscopic water droplets in the air, generally reducing the horizontal visibility at the earth's surface to less than 1 km. frontthe interface or transition zone between air masses of different densities ( temperature and humidity ). gale force windwind with a speed between 34 and 47 knots. beaufort scale wind force 8 or 9. gustsudden, brief increase of the wind speed over its mean value. hazesuspension in the atmosphere of extremely small, dry particles which are invisible to the naked eye but numerous enough to give the sky an opalescent appearance. highregion of the atmosphere where the pressures are high relative to those in the surrounding region at the same level. hurricanename given to a warm core tropical cyclone with maximum surface winds of 118 km / h ( 64 knots ) or greater in the north atlantic, the caribbean, the gulf of mexico and in the eastern north pacific ocean. knotunit of speed equal to one nautical mile per hour. ( 1. 852 km / h ) land breezewind of coastal regions, blowing at night from the land towards a large water surface as a result of the nocturnal cooling of the land surface. line squal
