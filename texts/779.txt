hi andy, welcome to linux mint programming with python is fun, at least i think so. many programs developed by linux mint are actually written in python, like the software manager and update manager for example. so i hope you do pick it up, but most important is you have a good time and enjoy using linux mint google has a very basic python class to get you started : https : / / developers. google. com / edu / python /. the hitchhiker's guide to python may be a nice resource along the way also : http : / / docs. python - guide. org / en / latest / index. html. another good resource is learn python the hard way, which throws you in the deep end but gets you going fast with the basics : http : / / learnpythonthehardway. org / book /. you don't need much to get started, gedit or kate both already have syntax highlighting for python source code, though you may want to look into a lightweight programmer's editor like geany to get a little more productive as your programming skills grow ( you can install it from the software manager ; i recommend you also install geany - plugins for some extra tools ). but there are plenty of other programmer's editors and ides suitable for use with python.
