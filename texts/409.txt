the warrior diet exercise and nutrition program, created by ori hofmekler, hinges on a somewhat controversial diet based on a daily cycle of “ undereating ” during the day and “ overeating ” at night. the rationale is that the historic “ warrior ”, in order to succeed in the environment of the time, had a primal need to cycle between undereating during the day ( when physical activity and danger were always present ), and overeating at night ( when able to rest and eat a good daily meal ). modern humans in a changed environment can therefore restore health and fitness, by returning to that cycle with the warrior diet. warrior diet grounding the nervous system is the primary focus here, specifically that part called the autonomic nervous system ( ans ). body organs such as the heart, stomach and intestines ( viscera ), and muscles within these organs and other areas like blood vessels, skin, and eyes, as well as the glands of the body, are regulated by the ans. we are mostly unaware of its workings ; for example, when blood vessels change size or when our heart beats faster, these functions are involuntary and reflexive in nature. the ans has 3 parts - - the sympathetic nervous system ( sns ) which kicks in when emergencies occur, causing stress and requiring us to “ fight ” or take “ flight ” ( flee ) - the parasympathetic nervous system ( psns ) which operates in normal or nonemergency times, allowing us to “ rest ” and “ digest ” - the enteric nervous system ( ens ), present in all vertebrates, which regulates the normal digestive activity of the digestive
