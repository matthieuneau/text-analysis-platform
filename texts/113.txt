basic use to make a new number, a simple initialization suffices : var foo = 0 ; / / or whatever number you want foo = 1 ; / / foo = 1 foo + = 2 ; / / foo = 3 ( the two gets added on ) foo - = 2 ; / / foo = 1 ( the two gets removed ) number literals define the number value. in particular : they appear as a set of digits of varying length. negative literal numbers have a minus sign before the set of digits. floating point literal numbers contain one decimal point, and may optionally use the e notation with the character e. an integer literal may be prepended with " 0 ", to indicate that a number is in base - 8. ( 8 and 9 are not octal digits, and if found, cause the integer to be read in the normal base - 10 ). an integer literal may also be found with " 0x ", to indicate a hexadecimal number. the math object unlike strings, arrays, and dates, the numbers aren't objects. the math object provides numeric functions and constants as methods and properties. the methods and properties of the math object are referenced using the dot operator in the usual way, for example : var varone = math. ceil ( 8. 5 ) ; var varpi = math. pi ; var sqrt3 = math. sqrt ( 3 ) ; methods random ( ) generates a pseudo - random number. var myint = math. random ( ) ; max ( int1, int2 ) returns the highest number from the two numbers passed as arguments. var myint = math. max ( 8, 9 ) ; document. write
