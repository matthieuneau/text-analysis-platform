smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, gas detectors smoke detector information : most people are aware of the danger of fire but are unaware of the fatality of smoke. more people die from breathing smoke than by burns. in fact, deaths from smoke inhalation outnumber deaths by burning by 2 : 1. in a hostile fire, smoke and deadly gases tend to spread farther and faster than heat from flames. moreover, when people are asleep, deadly fumes can send them deeper into unconsciousness. smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors are a powerful and effective fire safety technology. they are the first lines of defense against smoke and fire. they may awaken those who would otherwise have been overcome by smoke and toxic gases in their sleep. and most importantly, they provide an early warning alerting individuals of a fire, allowing them precious time to escape. according to the national fire protection association ( nfpa ), 75 to 80 % of all deaths by fire happen in the home. more than half of these deaths occurred in buildings without smoke detectors. by installing a smoke detector, individuals can reduce the risk of dying by almost 50 %. ionization smoke detectors monitor'ions,'or electrically charged particles in the air. air molecules in a sample chamber of ionization smoke detectors, are'ionized'by a radioactive source. this allows a small electrical current flow. smoke particles entering the sensing chamber change the electrical balance of the air. the greater the amount of smoke, the higher the electrical imbalance. when combustion particles enter the smoke detector, they obstruct the flow of the current. an alarm is pre - programmed to sound when the current gets too low. ionization smoke detectors respond first to fast flaming
