westminster confession of faith the westminster confession of faith is perhaps the most notable expression in creedal form of the truths of the bible. it was the work of that assembly of divines which was called together by parliament and met in london, at westminster abbey, during the years 1643 - 1648. it was this assembly which also produced the larger and shorter catechisms. the confession and the catechisms are used by many churches as their doctrinal standards, subordinate to the word of god. the text of the confession as given in this document is in the form adopted by the bible presbyterian church in 1938, and, except for a few revisions, which are largely concerned with eschatology, as well as with the relation of the civil magistrate to the church, it agrees with the text of the original manuscript of the confession. a list of changes can be found here, together with the reading of the original.
