the life - giving ideas of chemistry are not reducible to physics. or, if one tries to reduce them, they wilt at the edges, lose not only much of their meaning, but interest too. and, most importantly, they lose their chemical utility — their ability to relate seemingly disparate compounds to each other, their fecundity in inspiring new experiments. i'm thinking of concepts such as the chemical bond, a functional group and the logic of substitution, aromaticity, steric effects, acidity and basicity, electronegativity and oxidation - reduction. as well as some theoretical ideas i've been involved in personally — through - bond coupling, orbital symmetry control, the isolobal analogy. consider the notion of oxidation state. if you had to choose two words to epitomize the same - and - not - the - same nature of chemistry, would you not pick ferrous and ferric? the concept evolved at the end of the 19th century ( not without confusion with " valency " ), when the reality of ions in solution was established. as did a multiplicity of notations — ferrous iron is iron in an oxidation state of + 2 ( or is it 2 +? ) or fe ( ii ). schemes for assigning oxidation states ( sometimes called oxidation numbers ) adorn every introductory chemistry text. they begin with the indisputable : in compounds, the oxidation states of the most electronegative elements ( those that hold on most tightly to their valence electrons ), oxygen and fluorine for example, are – 2 and – 1, respectively. after that the rules grow ornate, desperately struggling to balance wide applicability with
