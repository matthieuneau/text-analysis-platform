most active stories sun september 25, 2011 launch logistics : speedy rocket, slow electronics weird things jump out at me in press releases. take the press kit nasa prepared for the grail mission. grail consists of two nearly identical spacecraft that are on their way to the moon. once there, they will make a precise map of the moon's gravitational field. such a map will help scientists refine their theories about how the moon formed and what the interior is made of. so i'm reading through the grail press kit, learning about the size of the spacecraft ( washing machine - sized ), how long it will take to make the map ( approximately three months ), and where the mission control room is ( at a lockheed martin facility just outside of denver ). i also learn that grail can launch any day between sept. 9 and oct. 19. and then i get to this sentence : " on each day, there are two separate, instantaneous launch opportunities separated in time by approximately 39 minutes. " that's weird. now, i wasn't surprised that this mission had an extremely precise launch opportunity â€” " instantaneous " means the launch window is essentially a second long. i know you have to wait until the moon's orbit around the earth, and earth's orbit around the sun, and the earth's rotation around its axis are all in exactly the right position before you can launch your rocket. but what's up with two instantaneous launch opportunities. why 39 minutes apart? i called the nasa press office. they were stumped and promised they'd find someone who could give me the answer. in the meantime, i called several universities with large aerospace programs, and asked if anyone
