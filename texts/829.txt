this sturdy, tannic, plumy red wine grape, a staple of bordeaux for over a century, was in decline until it was discovered by argentina. this was in fact a rediscovery, because malbec's root origins in argentina date to the days before phylloxera in the earlier 20th century. its character is more plum - like than merlot and slightly more tannic that cabernet sauvignon. it is still used in the french southwest in the dark, tannic wine of cahors, where the grape is known as cot. though chile and australia also have adopted malbec, it's argentina that has made its reputation. there, it becomes a rich, lush red that can develop complexity as it ages.
