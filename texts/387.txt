published : oct. 17, 2006 updated : apr. 20, 2010 two - and - a - half - year - old nina was bright - eyed and bouncy, full of laughter and hugs - - when you could get her attention. she often seemed to be ignoring her parents when they spoke to her, and when she did respond, many of her words were slurred. concerned, her parents arranged for a hearing test - - and learned that nina had moderate hearing loss in both ears. outfitted with a hearing aid, and provided with speech therapy, she is just beginning to regain some of the ground she lost during the first years of life when important language skills are being learned. " hearing impairment is the largest congenital disability, affecting about six out of every 1, 000 infants, " says duke pediatric audiologist ann mabie. " for a very long time, people thought you couldn't test infants'hearing, and would just wait until children were two or three years old. but by the time you wait for children not to talk, a window of opportunity has shut. " in fact, those tiny, shell - like ears that parents marvel over when getting to know their new babies are just the most visible parts of a highly sophisticated machine. human infants spend the first year of life learning about their environment, and by one year of age, already understand far more language than they are yet able to use - - unless an undiagnosed hearing impairment disrupts the process. while hearing impairments are difficult at any age, they â€™ re especially devastating in young children, because their brains rely on auditory stimulation to develop the capacity for oral communication. this makes early diagnosis and treatment of childhood hearing losses essential. happily
