the aviation sector is renowned as a carbon intensive business, but an increasing number of airports are looking to change that by integrating the latest green - tech into their daily operations. air travel and transport accounts for two percent of all human generated greenhouse gas emissions, according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ( ipcc ) - - with airports contributing five percent to the overall aviation figure. by adapting clean energy policies and technologies, eco - conscious airport operators hope to make a dent in these numbers and boost the industry's environmental street - cred. " we are making our airports greener, while balancing the tremendous economic impacts they deliver for our region, " says amy malick, deputy commissioner of sustainability for the chicago department of aviation ( cda ), which will host the fifth annual airports going green conference this november. the conference provides a platform for over 400 airport executives and green thinkers from around the world to present programs, strategies, and lessons - learned regarding airport sustainability. " ( we are ) committed to implementing sustainable initiatives at our airports that enhance the quality of life for citizens, " she adds. malick highlights how the cda has installed over 230, 000 square feet of vegetated roof space at chicago o'hare and midway international airport, ensured all chicago airport trucks are fueled with ultra - low sulfur diesel gas and insisted recycled materials are utilized in all airports when possible. as a result, the cda has saved 76, 000 tons of co2 from being pumped out by chicago's airports alone, she claims. across the u. s. like - minded schemes are taking off with increasing regularity. airports such as boston logan and denver international now generate a small percentage of their energy requirements from renewable energy
