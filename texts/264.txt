the gram - schmidt process now that we have a real or complex inner product, we have notions of length and angle. this lets us define what it means for a collection of vectors to be “ orthonormal ” : each pair of distinct vectors is perpendicular, and each vector has unit length. in formulas, we say that the collection is orthonormal if. these can be useful things to have, but how do we get our hands on them? it turns out that if we have a linearly independent collection of vectors then we can come up with an orthonormal collection spanning the same subspace of. even better, we can pick it so that the first vectors span the same subspace as. the method goes back to laplace and cauchy, but gets its name from jørgen gram and erhard schmidt. we proceed by induction on the number of vectors in the collection. if, then we simply set this “ normalizes ” the vector to have unit length, but doesn ’ t change its direction. it spans the same one - dimensional subspace, and since it ’ s alone it forms an orthonormal collection. now, lets assume the procedure works for collections of size and start out with a linearly independent collection of vectors. first, we can orthonormalize the first vectors using our inductive hypothesis. this gives a collection which spans the same subspace as ( and so on down, as noted above ). but isn ’ t in the subspace spanned by the first vectors ( or else the original collection wouldn ’ t have been linearly independent ). so it points at least somewhat in a new direction. to find this new
