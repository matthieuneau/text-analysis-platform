historical aerial photographs prior to the trial, jan schlichtmann, the plaintiffs attorney, hired a consulting firm to acquire and analyze historic aerial photographs of the riley 15 - acre property to estimate the times when the various drums, barrels, and debris piles first appeared. the consultants took this analysis and compared it to the 1985 field mapping of the debris piles, drums, and tanks on the 15 - acre property by john drobinski, a geologist hired by schlichtmann. drobinski's field map can be downloaded from the trial documents collection and excerpts of his deposition can be downloaded from the trial testimony collection. what are aerial photographs and how are they used? aerial photographs like the ones shown below routinely are taken by the u. s. department of agriculture and u. s. geological survey to make topographic maps, record temporal changes in crop patterns, map geology and mineral resources, and evaluate floodplains. a specialized aircraft with sophisticated cameras is used to take photographs using black & white or color infrared film. the aircraft flies along flight lines that overlap slightly while the camera takes photographs at time intervals that allow the images to overlap. because of the overlap is from two different positions in the sky, the overlapping portions of adjacent images can be viewed in 3 - d. a stereoscope is needed to see the images in 3 - d, which produces a static visual image that is similar to looking at a 3 - d movie using red and blue glasses. thus, tree tops and buildings appear to be higher than surrounding ground, whereas stream channels and wetlands appear to be lower. aerial photographs of the woburn wells g and h area the collection below is a subset of those compiled by maura metheny for her dissertation research at
