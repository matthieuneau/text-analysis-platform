eighteen years ago, the eminent conservation biologist gary meffe warned of what he considered to be the greatest problem in human history – humanity ’ s inexorable and exponential increase in numbers. meffe ’ s paper, entitled ‘ human population control : the missing agenda ’ published in the journal conservation biology, outlined the threats posed by an ever - increasing human population to biodiversity in terms of species extinctions, and to the ecosystem services necessary for our survival. these include water and air purification, hydrologic cycling and food production. not only is humanity ’ s deluge drowning the creatures we share the earth with, but it also runs the risk of submerging itself too. but was this ‘ missing agenda ’ acknowledged? was a dam constructed to stem our exponential flow? nearly two decades later and we see the publication of the un ’ s state of world population report 2011. it announced that on october 31st we reached the population milestone of seven billion people inhabiting our world. instead of warning of future population growth and the associated negative impact, it had a more positive tone that encouraged us to ask “ what can i do to make our world better? ” rather than “ are we too many? ” this is the united nations after all, and understandably it has to take a progressive and reassuring stance rather than one of doom and gloom. but the angle taken is perhaps revealing of the prevailing attitude of the global collective consciousness – population growth is inevitable and cannot be stopped. of course there ’ s no such thing as a global collective consciousness, explaining in part why meffe ’ s view has been largely ignored, because humanity lacks a collective impetus and so anything that requires mass cohesion, for instance only having one child or reducing carbon emissions,
