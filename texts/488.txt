" a sensitive test capable of quantifying a patient's cancer risk is needed to avoid the adoption of a'wait - and - see'intervention, " study lead investigator and test inventor dr. muy - teck teh said in a university news release. " detecting cancer early, coupled with appropriate treatment, can significantly improve patient outcomes, reduce mortality and alleviate long - term public health care costs. " although
