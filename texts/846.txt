glasses - free 3d is something available on just a handful of tvs, which manage it only through complicated hardware, and at no small cost. still, the effect is pretty smooth and no more tiresome for the eyes than glasses - assisted technology, from what we've been able to gather. there is one more accomplishment that tech experts are looking for : holographic television, which offers a different perspective at the action, depending on the angle from which one beholds the tv. researchers from the massachusetts institute of technology ( mit ) claim to have created something of the sort. called tensor display, it uses several layers of liquid crystal displays ( lcds ) with a refresh rate of 360 hz per second. the technique is different from the one used in nintendo's 3ds, which has two layers of lcd screens ( the bottom for light and dark bands and the top for the two slightly offset images ). the problem with this old method ( a century old really ) is that the only way so far known for creating multiple perspectives would rely on complicated hardware and algorithms. hundreds of perspectives would have to be produced in order to suit a moving viewer, and that means that too much info has to be displayed at once. every frame of the stereo - 3d video would need the screen to flicker 10 times, each with a different pattern. thus, a convincing stereo - 3d illusion would need a 1, 000 hz refresh rate. mit's tensor display lowers that requirement by using a higher number of lcds, although it does bring another problem : the pattern calculation becomes more complex. fortunately, the researcher had a convenient factor to exploit : not all aspects of a scene change with the viewing angle. this reduced the amount of
