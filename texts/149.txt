friday, 11 december 2009 mental ray _ adding glow to the window glass the above image was produced whilst at gmj design ltd in our latest book, we have covered a number of ways of emulating light without the need of creating a physical light. production companies often adopt similar methods to reduce the rendering times and retain the overall quality. it is worth pointing out that the usage of ambient occlusion ( i. e. ao ) as a separate pass or / and directly from max is utterly imperative for the final shot. the following exercise will take you through another unique methodology of achieving similar results with reduced rendering times : another quick way of emulating “ glow ” / " light " on windows, is to in fact enable the glow function on the glass panes themselves. to do this, simply go to the main material parameters, under the " refraction " group. 1 - reduce the transparency to about 0. 9 to prevent the surface from being fully transparent. 2 - to add a bit of blur to the transparency, decrease the glossiness to about 0. 78. note that, these values may vary depending on one ’ s camera angle... and the level of transparency / blurriness intended. 3 - next, change the colour swatch from white to a warm yellow. also, the " fast ( interpolate ) " function, can be enabled for quick and fast results, as the glossiness and its samples can often slow down the renders. however, it may create artifacts. 4 - pan down to the " self illumination ( glow ) " parameters and enable the " self illumination ( glow ) " function. 5 - under the " luminance " group, change it from " unitless "
