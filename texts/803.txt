indo - china : the new frontier time. monday, may. 29, 1950 the u. s. now has a new frontier and a new ally in the cold war. the place is indo - china, a southeast asian jungle, mountain and delta land that includes the republic of viet nam and the smaller neighboring kingdoms of laos and cambodia, all parts of the french union. for more than three years this land, in prewar times the rich french colony of indo - china, has been suffering, on a lesser scale, the ruinous kind of civil war which won china for communism. the mao tse - tung of the indo - chinese is a frail, but enduring comrade, who looks like a shriveled wizard ; his nom de guerre is ho chi minh ( or one who shines ). chiang kai - shek has no counterpart in indo - china. the initial brunt of the red attack has been borne by french soldiers. meanwhile, the job of rallying native anti - communist forces falls mainly on the meaty shoulders of the emperor bao dai ( or guardian of greatness ), who now bears the official title of chief of state of viet nam. while the dust of the chinese civil war was settling before the bemused eyes of the state department, the u. s. paid scant attention to the indo - chinese struggle. it seemed largely a local affair between the french and their subjects. since the dust has settled in china, asia ’ s communism is thrusting southward. indo - china stands first on the path to singapore, manila and the indies ( see map ). last january, led by peking and moscow, the world ’ s communist bloc recognized ho chi minh ’ s “ democratic republic.
