the physics help forum not working today, at least not from my isp, so this goes here. it's basically a math deal anyway : the formula to calculate the force of a point of mass, let's call them planets, that results from its being gravitationally attracted by another point of mass is newton's : where is the force of the planet that results from the gravitational attraction exerted upon it by the other planet, is newton's gravity constant, and are the respecive masses of the planets, and d is the distance between them. for simplicity's sake let's say all the planets considered are of the same mass, so we can write instead of. now, if i'm not mistaken, the formula for calculating the force of a planet resulting from the gravitational attraction of more than two planets is : where is the force on the jth planet resulting from the gravitational attraction of the other planets, and is the distance between the jth planet and the kth planet. my question is " where is the vector addition? " that is, when considering the force on one planet that results from the gravitational attraction of many other planets, we have to take into account not only the distance of the other planets from planet j but also their position with respect to it ( right? ). take for example the simple case of three planets in the same plane. planet j is at the origin. planet k is one unit to the right of j on the x axis, while planet l is one unit up the y axis. if the masses all equal 1, then, by the formula above, the force on planet j would be : but is a function of both the distance and the position
