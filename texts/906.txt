teaching strategies : effective discussion leading while lecturing is a fast and direct way to communicate a body of knowledge, discussion encourages students to discover solutions for themselves and to develop their critical thinking abilities. they learn how to generate ideas, consider relevant issues, evaluate solutions, and consider the implications of these solutions. thus, although discussion is not as efficient as lecture in conveying facts, it helps students learn how to think better and more clearly about the facts that they should learn from their reading and their lectures. leading a discussion, however, offers its own set of challenges : participants can spend too much time exploring small, sometimes irrelevant issues, forget that they are progressing toward an identifiable goal, and become bored. the leader must guide the conversation carefully without stifling creativity and students'initiative and without surrendering to some students'desire for answers that they can write down and memorize. here are four strategies that can help faculty and tas encourage students explore issues themselves : we all know that creating a fine lecture requires research and planning ; we sometimes forget that leading a good discussion requires the same research and planning and demands spontaneous responses in the classroom. the beauty of the extra demand is that developing the skills for intervening and directing discussions leads to exciting, productive exchanges that help students learn to think clearly and creatively, while simultaneously inspiring you to teach more thoroughly and carefully.
