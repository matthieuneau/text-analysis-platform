tiredness and speeding are the primary causes of accidents involving transportation professionals. they are well aware of the risks of driving with a certain amount of fatigue, whether from a lack of sleep, physical problems, poor posture at the wheel or daily stress. one of the ways to effectively fight fatigue is to respect driving times - all carriers are aware of the limits : no more than 9 hours per day and 56 hours per week, with a mandatory stop of at least 45 minutes every 4 and a half hours. this allows for a little rest and a chance to recover some strength before continuing on the road. the right climate control in the cabin, light meals and frequent hydration also help. other procedures for battling fatigue are based on new technologies, such as electronic devices that monitor the driver's attention ; these are built into some trucks and are add - ons in others, as is the case of the optalert sunglasses, which fulfill a similar function. as professional drivers already know, there are additional devices that can help avoid accidents caused by distraction, often due to tiredness, such as those that sound an alarm at an involuntary change of lane, or those that detect objects in the blind spot. several makes, such as daf, man, scania or volvo trucks, have these already built into their models.
