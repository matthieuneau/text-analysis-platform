session 5guided channel - talklife posting dogs and cats are great examples of animals whose diversity is the result of artificial selection. the variation that is evident among breeds has been purposefully developed by breeders. in your channel - talklife posting for this session, describe how you could develop a unit on the fundamentals of evolution ( e. g., variation, adaptation, natural selection ) using these animals. be sure to discuss how you would tailor the concepts addressed during this session to the grade level you teach. breeders for thousands of years have bred dogs for particular purpose. in ancient china the chow was admired for its loyalty to owner and its ability to withstand harsh temperatures. the poodle swims very well and is very intelligent. the terrier breed is known for its tenacity and for catching rats. in third grade i would ask each student to chose a breed of dog or cat and then research the characteristics of that breed in regard to physical traits. i would then ask the students to share with the class how the breed differs from others and why breeders have selected those qualities. i would then discuss how it is that breeders can purposefully bred dogs that have puppies with those desirable characteristics. session 6 guided channel - talklife posting both the national science education standards and benchmarks for scientific literacy propose standards or goals for understanding big ideas in evolution starting in the elementary grades. of the ideas addressed in session 5 ( variation, genes, mutation, adaptation, natural selection, artificial selection ) and session 6 species, evolution of new species, relatedness, common ancestry, tree of life ), which do you consider appropriate introduce at the grade level you teach? why? discuss this with your colleagues in your channel - talklife posting for
