by i. peterson unlike an ordinary, incandescent bulb, a laser produces light of a single wavelength. moreover, the emitted light waves are coherent, meaning that all of the energy peaks and troughs are precisely in step. now, a team at the massachusetts institute of technology has demonstrated experimentally that a cloud consisting of millions of atoms can also be made coherent. instead of flying about and colliding randomly, the atoms display coordinated behavior, acting as if the entire assemblage were a single entity. according to quantum mechanics, atoms can behave like waves. thus, two overlapping clouds made up of atoms in coherent states should produce a zebra - striped interference pattern of dark and light fringes, just like those generated when two beams of ordinary laser light overlap. by detecting such a pattern, the researchers proved that the clouds'atoms are coherent and constitute an " atom laser, " says physicist wolfgang ketterle, who heads the mit group. these matter waves, in principle, can be focused just like light. ketterle and his coworkers describe their observations in the jan. 31 science. the demonstration of coherence involving large numbers of atoms is the latest step in a series of studies of a remarkable state of matter called a bose - einstein condensate. chilled to temperatures barely above absolute zero, theory predicted, the atoms would collectively enter the same quantum state and behave like a single unit, or superparticle, with a specific wavelength. first created in the laboratory in 1995 by eric a. cornell and his collaborators at the university of colorado and the national institute of standards and technology, both in boulder, bose - einstein condensates have been the subject of intense investigation ever since ( sn
