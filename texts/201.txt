kristensen, hanne l. and thorup - kristensen, kristian ( 2006 ) roots below one meters depth are important for nitrate uptake by annual crops. [ rødder under 1 meters dybde er vigtige for et - arige afgrøders optagelse af nitrat. ] in : cd - rom " the american society of agronomy - crop science society of america - soil science society of america international annual meetings, november 12 - 16, 2006, indianapolis, usa. no. 205 - 9., cd - rom " the american society of agronomy - crop science society of america - soil science society of america international annual meetings, november 12 - 16, 2006, indianapolis, usa., no. abstract no. 205 - 9.. the root depths of annual crops vary from 0. 2 m to more than 2 m depending on root growth rate and length of growing season. however, studies of root growth and n uptake are often restricted to a depth of 1 m or less, as root biomass is assumed to be negligible below this depth. we have studied the importance of root growth and n uptake to a depth of 2. 5 m in fully grown field vegetables and cover crops by use of minirhizotrons and deep point placement of 15n. deep rooted crucifereous crops were found to have high root densities to a depth of 1. 5 - 2 m and high 15n uptake to this depth. the work shows that knowledge of the interactions between root growth and soil n below a depth of 1 m are important to understand crop n uptake and nitrate leaching from agro - ecosystems. | eprin
