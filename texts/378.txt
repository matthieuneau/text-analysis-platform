when it comes to solar power, the real dilemmas are efficiency and cost. on the one hand, efficiency has steadily improved over the last couple decades to the point where it ’ s approaching the utility prices of other power generation methods. exotic technologies promise even greater gains. however, the price of solar - generated power still remains at least five times as expensive as coal - power, the chief source of power in the u. s. ( compared to the leading candidate, nuclear, which is approximately 1. 5 to 2 times as expensive ). while solar adoption from a cost standpoint is unattractive, there's much debate over whether commercial adoption is needed to spur further research to propel solar into the realm of cost competitiveness. while many nations like the u. s. and china have modestly taken this position, adopting solar at a moderate rate, one nation has fallen head over heels for solar - - spain. spain is allowing solar and wind power plants to charge as much as 10 times the rates of coal power plants, making it possible for solar power installations to earn utilities big money. on average, recent rate increases have raised solar charges to over 7 times the rates of coal or natural gas rates. the costs are added onto consumers'power bills. the results are mixed ; while spanish power bills are at record highs, the number of deployments is soaring. spain has 14 gw of solar power, or the equivalent capacity of nine average nuclear reactors, under construction - - the most of any nation. florida ’ s fpl group inc. and french electricite de france sa are among the many jumping to build in spain. gabriel calzada, an economist and professor at rey juan carlos university in madrid,
