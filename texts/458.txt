only 1 % of all cancer cases in the u. s. are cancers of the testicle. but it is the most common form of cancer in young men. in 2012, it is estimated that there will be 8, 600 new cases of testicular cancer, and that 360 men will die from this disease. there are several risk factors for testicular cancer : - most cases happen in young men, typically 15 - 40 years of age. but older men may also develop the disease. - failure of one or both testicles to descend from within the body before birth ( known as cryptorchidism ). this raises the risk of cancer approximately ten - fold. - if there is cancer in one testicle, the risk for cancer in the other testicle goes up. - when a first - degree family member ( father, brother or son ) has been affected. - having klinefelters syndrome ( a congenital abnormality of chromosomes ). but in the majority of cases, there arent any risk factors present. and there is no evidence that injuring the testicle or getting a sexually transmitted disease ( other than hiv ) increases the risk of cancer. if its detected early, testicular cancer responds exceptionally well to treatment. the survival rate for early - stage tumors is over 95 %. treatment is less effective if the diagnosis is delayed. you should see your doctor right away if : - you have pain in your testicle - you notice new lumps - any of your testicles gets bigger some doctors recommend that young men do regular testicle self - exams. but there is no proof that self - exam leads to earlier diagnosis and better outcomes.
