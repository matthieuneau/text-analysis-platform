lans to wans ( c ) the complete management guide authors : muller n. j. published year : 2003 | < day day up > | depending on the situation facing network managers, bridges can be used to either extend or segment lans. at one level, bridges can be used for segmenting lans into smaller subnets to improve performance, control access, and facilitate fault isolation and testing without impacting the overall user population. at another level, they are used to create an extended network that greatly expands the number of devices that can be supported and the services available to each user. bridges may even offer additional features such as data compression, which has the effect of providing greater throughput over low - speed lines. compression ratios of 2 : 1 all the way down to 6 : 1 may be selected by the network manager, depending on what the vendor offers with a specific product. as noted, bridging occurs at the data link layer ( see figure 5. 1 ), which provides physical addressing, manages access to the physical medium, controls data flow, and handles transmission errors. bridges analyze incoming frames, make forwarding decisions based on the source and destination addresses of those frames, and then forward the frames to their destinations. sometimes, as in source - route bridging, the frame contains the entire path to the destination. in other cases, as in transparent bridging, frames are forwarded one hop at a time toward the destination. figure 5. 1 : bridge functionality in reference to the osi model. bridges can be either local or remote. local bridges provide direct connections between many lan segments in the same area. remote bridges connect lan segments in different areas, usually over telecommunication lines. there are several kinds
