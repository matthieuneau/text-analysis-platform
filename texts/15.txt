wikipedia sobre fisica de particulas rapidinho. me falaram que a definicao de fisica de particulas da wikipedia era muito ruim. e de fato, era assim : particle physics is a branch of physics that studies the elementary particle | elementary subatomic constituents of matter and radiation, and their interactions. the field is also called high energy physics, because many elementary particles do not occur under ambient conditions on earth. they can only be created artificially during high energy collisions with other particles in particle accelerators. particle physics has evolved out of its parent field of nuclear physics and is typically still taught in close association with it. scientific research in this area has produced a long list of particles. mas hein? particulas que so podem ser criadas em aceleradores? fisica de particulas e ensinada junto com fisica nuclear? a pesquisa produz particulas ( essa e otima! )? em que mundo essa pessoa vive? reescrevi : particle physics is a branch of physics that studies the existence and interactions of particles, which are the constituents of what is usually referred as matter or radiation. in our current understanding, particles are excitations of quantum fields and interact following their dynamics. most of the interest in this area is in fundamental fields, those that cannot be described as a bound state of other fields. the set of fundamental fields and their dynamics are summarized in a model called the standard model and, therefore, particle physics is largely the study of the standard model particle content and its possible extensions. eu acho que ficou bem
