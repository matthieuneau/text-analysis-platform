european ports install radiation detectors as u. s. delays just last week, u. s. officials announced that the homeland security department is slowing plans to roll out 1, 400 monitors, each costing nearly $ 400, 000, as part of a $ 1. 2 billion multiyear project. in field tests, the new advanced spectroscopic portal monitors, or asps, " led to the determination that additional functional capacity is needed to meet the operational standards, " a department spokeswoman announced. the announcement, which means the machines could take another year to reach u. s. ports, comes after more than a year of sparring between dhs officials and the government accountability office over how effective the technology is as well as testing methods used to evaluate it. the debate over the new equipment has largely played out in congressional hearings. in september, government accountability office officials argued that dhs testing was based on a " biased " methodology that allowed vendors an artificial edge during the evaluation of their radiation detectors, an allegation homeland security officials said was off base. officials at the belgian port of antwerp, however, are moving ahead with deployment of the asps for use in secondary screening. " we're in the process of finalizing it now, " pascal fias, a scientist working at the antwerp port, said last week during an international atomic energy agency - sponsored conference on nuclear trafficking here. in the netherlands, dutch customs officials are already using the asp detectors in secondary deployments and expect to eventually use them as primary scanners, fias said. containers at ports are typically put through a two - phase scanning process. during the first phase, the shipping containers are sent through very sensitive detectors called plastic scintillators
