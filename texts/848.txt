warmer temperatures, variable monsoons, and other signs of climate change are a hot topic of conversation among many himalayan villagers, according to scientific sampling of climate change perception among local peoples. “ this area is cold and it ’ s often raining. even during the non - monsoon times there is mist and fog so inevitably conversations here turn to weather, ” said kamal bawa, biologist at the university of massachusetts, boston ( umb ), and president of ashoka trust for research in ecology and the environment ( atree ) in bangalore, india. “ when you stop and have a cup of tea in someone ’ s kitchen, the conversation invariably turns to the weather. but then they soon start talking about how the weather has been changing. ” bawa is also a member of the national geographic committee for research and exploration. bawa didn ’ t set out to study himalayan perceptions of climate change. but after hearing the same themes repeated again and again during household conversations he decided to investigate. with umb graduate student pahupati chaudhary, he surveyed some 500 homes spread across 18 villages in darjeeling hills, west bengal, india and nepal ’ s ilam district. the pair found some surprisingly consistent observations. three - fourths of the people surveyed believe that their weather is getting warmer and two - thirds believe that summer and monsoon season have begun earlier over the past ten years. seventy percent believe that water sources are drying up while forty - six percent said that they think there is less snow on the high mountains. many villagers also told chaudhary they ’ d noticed shifts in some species ranges and earlier flowering and budding of plants. new pests have also arrived, villagers routinely reported, to plague crops and people
