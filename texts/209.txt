researchers at ut southwestern medical center have found that fluctuations in internal body temperature regulate the body's circadian rhythm, the 24 - hour cycle that controls metabolism, sleep and other bodily functions. a light - sensitive portion of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( scn ) remains the body's " master clock " that coordinates the daily cycle, but it does so indirectly, according to a study published by ut southwestern researchers in the oct. 15 issue of science. the scn responds to light entering the eye, and so is sensitive to cycles of day and night. while light may be the trigger, the ut southwestern researchers determined that the scn transforms that information into neural signals that set the body's temperature. these cyclic fluctuations in temperature then set the timing of cells, and ultimately tissues and organs, to be active or inactive, the study showed. scientists have long known that body temperature fluctuates in warm - blooded animals throughout the day on a 24 - hour, or circadian, rhythm, but the new study shows that temperature actually controls body cycles, said dr. joseph takahashi, chairman of neuroscience at ut southwestern and senior author of the study. " small changes in body temperature can send a powerful signal to the clocks in our bodies, " said dr. takahashi, an investigator with the howard hughes medical institute. " it takes only a small change in internal body temperature to synchronize cellular'clocks'throughout the body. " daily changes in temperature span only a few degrees and stay within normal healthy ranges. this mechanism has nothing to do with fever or environmental temperature, dr. takahashi said. this system might be a modification of an ancient circadian control system that first developed in other organisms
