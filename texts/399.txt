1. linguistic background the languages that are currently spoken in the pacific region can be divided broadly into three groups : the australian and new guinean languages formed by people who participated in the region ’ s earliest migrations over a period of 20, 000 - 30, 000 years starting several tens of thousands of years ago, and the austronesian languages spoken by mongoloid people who migrated from the asian continent around 3, 000 b. c. the region has numerous languages, including 250 aboriginal languages in australia and 750 papuan languages on the island of new guinea ( including the indonesian territory of irian jaya ) and neighboring areas. there are also 350 austronesian languages in melanesia, 20 in polynesia, 12 in micronesia and 100 in new guinea ( comrie, matthews, and polinsky 1996 ). there is wide variation not only among language groups, but also among the families of languages. few language families have been identified among the languages of australia and new guinea using the methods of comparative linguistics. pacific languages are also characterized by the small size of speaker populations and by the absence of dominant languages. however, there are usually bilingual people who can speak or at least understand the languages of neighboring populations, and it is believed that this situation has existed for a long time. in terms of cultural factors, it appears that the diversification of languages in the pacific region was accelerated by the emblematic function of language in the creation of a clear distinction between “ ingroup ” and “ outgroup. ” the languages of new guinea and the region around it show diverse linkages and wide variations between languages. the austronesian languages of the pacific region are mostly classified as oceanian languages, while the chamorro and palau languages of micronesia
