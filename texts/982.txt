first ever direct measurement of the earth ’ s rotation geodesists are pinpointing the orientation of the earth ’ s axis using the world ’ s most stable ring laser a group with researchers at the technical university of munich ( tum ) and the federal agency for cartography and geodesy ( bkg ) are the first to plot changes in the earth ’ s axis through laboratory measurements. to do this, they constructed the world ’ s most stable ring laser in an underground lab and used it to determine changes in the earth ’ s rotation. previously, scientists were only able to track shifts in the polar axis indirectly by monitoring fixed objects in space. capturing the tilt of the earth ’ s axis and its rotational velocity is crucial for precise positional information on earth – and thus for the accurate functioning of modern navigation systems, for instance. the scientists ’ work has been recognized an exceptional research spotlight by the american physical society. the earth wobbles. like a spinning top touched in mid - spin, its rotational axis fluctuates in relation to space. this is partly caused by gravitation from the sun and the moon. at the same time, the earth ’ s rotational axis constantly changes relative to the earth ’ s surface. on the one hand, this is caused by variation in atmospheric pressure, ocean loading and wind. these elements combine in an effect known as the chandler wobble to create polar motion. named after the scientist who discovered it, this phenomenon has a period of around 435 days. on the other hand, an event known as the “ annual wobble ” causes the rotational axis to move over a period of a year. this is due to the earth ’ s elliptical orbit around the sun. these two effects
