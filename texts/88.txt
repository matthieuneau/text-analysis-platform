in this section we will describe some basis of hardware involved in nano. block diagram power supply jz4720 support 3 different boot sources. the boot sequence is controlled by boot _ sel pin values [ 1 : 0 ]. the configuration of boot _ sel1 and boot _ sel1 [ 1 : 0 ] is showed as below : | 0 | | 0 | | boot from external rom at cs4 | | 0 | | 1 | | boot from usb device | | 1 | | 0 | | boot from 512 page size nand flash at cs1 | | 1 | | 1 | | boot from 2048 page size nand flash at cs1 | arquitectura general it is necessary, for the operation of the nanonote board to store many sections of executable programs in volatile and non - volatile memories. the volatile memories are used like random access memories ( ram ) due to its low access time and unlimited number of read / write cycles. on the other hand, the non - volatile memories ( nand, sd ) stores for long periods of time the required information to operate the embedded system. universal serial bus ( usb ) is a way of setting up communication between a computer and peripheral devices. usb is intended to replace many varieties of serial and parallel ports. usb can connect computer peripherals such as mice, keyboards, pdas, gamepads and joysticks, scanners, digital cameras, printers, personal media players, flash drives, and external hard drives. for many of those devices, usb has become the standard connection method. a usb system has an asymmetric design, consisting of a host, a multitude of downstream usb ports, and multiple peripheral devices connected in a tier
