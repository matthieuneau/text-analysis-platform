heal our planet earth secondary and universities educational outreach : secondary ( high ) schools and universities anthony marr from the hope foundation ’ s main point was the wild tigers. he believes that something must be done to keep these animals alive. " if we let this go, life will be less beautiful and worth less living, " anthony marr quoted. the money that he receives as a conservationist is donated to help out the endangered species. he makes many trips to india to help them find other solutions to their problems. if the people living in india keep living the way they ’ ve done, india will soon become a desert. changes need to be made and people need to adapt to these changes. i agree with anthony ’ s beliefs. even if tigers are bred, it does not make a difference, because they cannot survive on their own. no matter what humans do, it still will not change the fact that one of god ’ s creations is becoming destroyed. no animals should be killed for the purpose of human needs. it is not necessary to kill tigers to sell products and make money because of silly beliefs that of they eat this then something will happen. there are so many alternatives. humans need food, but they do not have to consume so much meat. every time they eat meat, a precious animal is being killed. animals do not kill us and eat us, then why should we do the same? more solutions need to be found and more people need to become more involved in saving the beauty of the world. go on to student - 10
