taking a sample is just the beginning and preserving and processing specimens requires more than just the e - word. having completed eight dives, at least sixteen shore excursions, one nightlighting session, six trips to the fish markets, several roadside purchases and a surprise swim up to a fishing boat, the scientists have well and truly justified that purchase of 90 litres of ethanol on day 1. on each trip the preserving began in the field and continued back at our accommodation. the specimens will soon be shipped to the museum where a thorough analysis can be performed, possibly including sem photography and dna sequencing. after that, identifications can be confirmed if necessary and scientific papers can be published. so how did the scientists start to process their samples here in timor? i spoke with about half the team to find out ( because talking to all of them would've made this post longer than a dead sea scroll ). lauren studies amphipods, an order of crustaceans, and was picking samples from dive sites ( and one nightlighting session ) with these small ( usually less then 10mm ) creatures in mind. she uses the freshwater dip method which means placing her substrate samples in a bucket of tap water as it encourages saltwater animals to release from their holds. lauren then elutriated ( swirled ) the bucket, causing the heavier sediment to fall to the bottom and the lighter amphipods to rise to the top. the swirling water was slowly tipped out into a sieve. what was filtered out was then placed in a tray and examined for animals, which were picked up with forceps or pipettes and placed into jars of ethanol. after that, the habitat samples that remained in the bucket were also placed in the tray and
