demands for lower cost manufacturing, lighter components, and recycleability are forcing manufacturers to switch from metal components to plastic. while the assembly processes are different, some of the same concerns apply. finding a reliable assembly equipment supplier, defining part requirements, getting them involved early, and choosing the right assembly process are the keys to success. chart outlines the different characteristics, capabilities, and requirements of a variety of plastic welding processes. click for the full - size graphic. appliance components come in all shapes and sizes, and each one has its own unique characteristics that demand an assembly process to fit. ultrasonic, hot - plate, spin, thermal, laser, and vibration welding are the most common plastic assembly methods. choosing the correct method can be difficult. a supplier who has technical knowledge in all of the processes is the best choice. they will have knowledge of all the different process joint designs, can provide assistance in material selection, and can support once the process is in production. part requirement before the design of the plastic part is critical. this will save dollars in tooling costs and help assure that the correct process to achieve the requirements is chosen. all too often, the plastic molds are manufactured, the first parts are assembled, and then quality control determines that the parts will not pass a pressure test. this is too late ; now significant dollars will need to be spent to correct problem. requirements such as a need for pressurization, exposure to extreme cold or heat, cosmetic - part status ( requires no blemishes ), and parts assembled per minute are all factors in determining the correct process and plastic each process has unique plastic - joint design requirements to assure proper weld strength. assembly equipment suppliers can help design the
