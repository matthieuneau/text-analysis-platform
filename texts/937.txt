first homer encyclopedia brings epic poetry and ancient greece to life tuesday, april 17, 2012 tau researcher sheds light on homer's reception in the western, jewish and arabic worlds homer, one of the most famous poets of all time, is firmly entrenched in the western canon as a master of classical literature. his two most renowned works, the iliad and the odyssey, are core texts for students and scholars alike. now, prof. margalit finkelberg of tel aviv university's department of classics has created an illuminating new tool, the world's first homer encyclopedia. published in three volumes by wiley - blackwell last year and more recently in electronic form, the encyclopedia is an invaluable window into homer's life and work, elucidating the characters and settings of his work from primary characters to the smallest village mentioned in passing. the volumes also examine the pre - history of homer and the period in which he lived and wrote, and how the text has been received and transmitted by various cultures and societies throughout history to the present day. one of its groundbreaking areas of research is the reception of homer in the jewish and arabic traditions, a subject that has rarely been explored. with contributions from 132 scholars worldwide, this three volume work is a universal exploration of all things homer. " through this encyclopedia, you can enter homer's world and get lost in it, " says prof. finkelberg, who was recently awarded the 2012 rothschild prize in the humanities. " it is unique for its comprehensive view â€” the entire field is seen as vibrant, alive and contemporary. homer's work is put in a modern living context, rather than approached as an impenetrable classic monument.
