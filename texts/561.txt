we look at five technologies that look set to become part of every day lives very soon, to find out how they'll change our lives. this technology could be a game - changer for device connectivity. a modern desktop computer today may include jacks to accommodate ethernet, usb 2. 0, firewire 400 or 800 ( ieee 1394a or 1394b ) or both, dvi or displayport or both, and - on some - esata. usb 3. 0 could eliminate all of these except ethernet. in their place, a computer may have several usb 3. 0 ports, delivering data to monitors, retrieving it from scanners, and exchanging it with hard drives. the improved speed comes at a good time, as much - faster flash memory drives are in the pipeline. usb 3. 0 is fast enough to allow uncompressed 1080p video ( currently our highest - definition video format ) at 60 frames per second, says jeff ravencraft, president and chair of the usb - if. that would enable a camcorder to forgo video compression hardware and patent licensing fees for mpeg - 4. the user could either stream video live from a simple camcorder ( with no video processing required ) or store it on an internal drive for later rapid transfer ; neither of these methods is feasible today without heavy compression. citing 3. 0's versatility, some analysts see the standard as a possible complement - or even alternative - to the consumer hdmi connection found on today's blu - ray players. the new usb flavor could also turn computers into real charging stations. whereas usb 2. 0 can produce 100 milliamperes ( ma ) of trickle charge for each port, usb
