you had surgery to treat your gastroesophageal reflux disease ( gerd ). gerd is a condition that causes food or liquid to come up from your stomach into your esophagus ( the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach ). your surgeon probably repaired a hiatal hernia with stitches. a hiatal hernia develops when the natural opening in your diaphragm is too large. your diaphragm is the muscle layer between your chest and belly. your stomach may bulge through this large hole into your chest. this bulging is called a hiatal hernia. it may make gerd symptoms worse. your surgeon also wrapped the upper part of your stomach around the end of your esophagus to create pressure at the end of your esophagus. this pressure helps prevent stomach acid and food from flowing back up. your surgery was done by making a large incision in your upper belly ( open surgery ) or with a laparoscope ( a thin tube with a tiny camera on the end ). what to expect at home most patients go back to work 2 - 3 weeks after laparoscopic surgery and 4 - 6 weeks after open surgery. you may have a feeling of tightness when you swallow for 6 - 8 weeks. this is from the swelling inside your esophagus. you may also have some bloating. when you get back home, you will be drinking a clear liquid diet for 2 weeks. you will be on a full liquid diet for about 2 weeks after that, and then a soft - food diet after that. on the liquid diet : start off with small amounts of liquid, about 1 cup at a time. sip.
