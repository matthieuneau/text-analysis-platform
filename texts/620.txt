the giving of the law at mount sinai was the climax of a series of events that began at passover, the moment and the means of the israelites'redemption. at passover they killed a lamb and put the blood on their doorposts. when the death angel passed through to slay the firstborn, those who had blood on the doorposts were spared. god was saving, redeeming, buying back his people. mount sinai adds the other half of the equation. though redemption through the blood of a lamb ( christ ) freed them from sin's dominion and death, the giving of the law at mount sinai shows that freeing them is not all that god had in mind. israel came to mount sinai after being redeemed, heard the law, and assented to keep it. god gave the law to show the pattern of life, the principles of righteousness, for the redeemed. on one side of the coin is grace and on the other is law and obedience. they are harmonious ; they cannot be separated. they are both vital parts of the process of sanctification leading to salvation. grace is given upon repentance from sin, but after repentance, what is a christian to do with his life? obedience to god and living a life of holiness become his first priorities, and these work to produce character in the image of god ( ii corinthians 3 : 18 ). amos 5 : 25 reconfirms that the sacrifice, offering, and shedding of blood is a foundational necessity for a relationship with god. " did you offer me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, o house of israel? " the answer is, " yes.
