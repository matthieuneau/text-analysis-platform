the chinook arch november 14, 2001 the above photo was taken at evening twilight in calgary, alberta by jeff mcintosh. on the lee ( eastern ) side of the rocky mountains in colorado, wyoming, montana, and the province of alberta in canada, chinook winds occasionally bring respite from cold weather. chinook is an indian name meaning " snow eater. " these warm, westerly winds result from downslope winds - air moving across the rocky mountains and down onto the prairies. during those cold, dull gray winter days, albertans sometimes look toward the mountains for the chinook arch, a curved patch of blue sky ( as shown above ) that indicates that warm winds are approaching. over this past weekend, a strong chinook was felt in alberta and montana. chinooks typically occur from early november to late march.
