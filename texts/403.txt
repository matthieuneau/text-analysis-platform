originally posted by wrtner any lr circuit which is driven by an alternating source, will show a trough in its graph of current v. frequency. that frequency will be the most efficient, the resonant frequency ; the frequency that the circuit best behaves at. what do you mean? pls elaborate... lr circuits have not resonance. not c component present... how to attain resonance in a signal with lr circuit? and how initial signal frequency can be altered to another output frquency.?
