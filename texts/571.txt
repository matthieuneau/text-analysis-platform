" he explains epigenetics. he describes how certain non - genetic factors that shape behavior may be inherited from one generation to the next. he discusses " sexual freaks " and sexual ambiguity in nature, and shows how in many ways, it is the norm in nature. he predicts the extinction of creationist thinking, and talks about how freaks of nature are a missed opportunity for those science advocates battling intelligent design and creationism, even as he also criticizes belief in " evolution's design " and " magical genes.
