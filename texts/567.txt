hyperparathyroidism in dogs excessive levels of parathyroid hormone in the blood in dogs the parathyroid hormone is responsible for regulating calcium and phosphorus levels in the blood, increasing blood calcium levels by causing calcium to be reabsorbed from bone. the parathyroid glands are small, hormone - secreting glands that are located on or near the thyroid glands. the term para - refers to adjacent or alongside, and thyroid refers to the actual thyroid gland ; the thyroid and parathyroid glands are located side by side in the neck, near the windpipe or trachea. hyperparathyroidism is a medical condition related to the parathyroid glands, in which over active parathyroid glands cause abnormally high levels of parathyroid hormone ( also known as parathormone or pth ) to circulate in the blood. primary hyperparathyroidism refers to a condition in which a tumor in the parathyroid gland produces excessive levels of parathyroid hormone, leading to increased blood calcium levels ( hypercalcemia ). secondary hyperparathyroidism can be caused by a deficiency of calcium and vitamin d, and is associated with malnutrition or long - term ( chronic ) kidney disease. there is no known genetic cause for primary hyperparathyroidism, but its association with certain breeds suggests a possible hereditary basis in some cases. secondary hyperparathyroidism can develop in association with hereditary kidney disease ( known as hereditary nephropathy ), but is not inherited per se. keeshonds seem to show some predilection for this disease. in dogs, the average age is ten years, with a range of 5 to 15 years of age
