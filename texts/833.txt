new study challenges previous findings that humans are an altruistic anomaly, and positions chimpanzees as cooperative, especially when their partners are patient. researchers at the yerkes national primate research center, have shown chimpanzees have a significant bias for prosocial behavior. this, the study authors report, is in contrast to previous studies that positioned chimpanzees as reluctant altruists and led to the widely held belief that human altruism evolved in the last six million years only after humans split from apes. the current study findings are available in the online edition of proceedings of the national academy of sciences. according to yerkes researchers victoria horner, phd, frans de waal, phd, and their colleagues, chimpanzees may not have shown prosocial behaviors in other studies because of design issues, such as the complexity of the apparatus used to deliver rewards and the distance between the animals. “ i have always been skeptical of the previous negative findings and their over - interpretation, says dr. de waal. “ this study confirms the prosocial nature of chimpanzees with a different test, better adapted to the species, ” he continues.
