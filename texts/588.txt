nov. 27, 2009 physicists from the japanese - led multi - national t2k neutrino collaboration have just announced that over the weekend they detected the first neutrino events generated by their newly built neutrino beam at the j - parc ( japan proton accelerator research complex ) accelerator laboratory in tokai, japan. protons from the 30 - gev main ring synchrotron were directed onto a carbon target, where their collisions produced charged particles called pions. these pions travelled through a helium - filled volume where they decayed to produce a beam of the elusive particles called neutrinos. these neutrinos then flew 200 metres through the earth to a sophisticated detector system capable of making detailed measurements of their energy, direction, and type. the data from the complex detector system is still being analysed, but the physicists have seen at least 3 neutrino events, in line with the expectation based on the current beam and detector performance. this detection therefore marks the beginning of the operational phase of the t2k experiment, a 474 - physicist, 13 - nation collaboration to measure new properties of the ghostly neutrino. neutrinos interact only weakly with matter, and thus pass effortlessly through the earth ( and mostly through the detectors! ). neutrinos exist in three types, called electron, muon, and tau ; linked by particle interactions to their more familiar charged cousins like the electron. measurements over the last few decades, notably by the super kamiokande and kamland neutrino experiments in western japan, have shown that neutrinos possess the strange property of neutrino oscillations, whereby one type of neutrino will
