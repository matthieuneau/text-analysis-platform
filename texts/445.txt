learning is the means whereby we acquire new working knowledge about the world. memory is the means whereby we retain that knowledge over time. our abilities to learn and remember are essential to our sense of self and our ability to function effectively in daily life. memory is the glue that holds our mental life together. as a result, we are who we are in large part because of what we have learned and what we remember from past experience. but what is memory? how does the brain capture and sustain it? why does memory sometimes fail us? those simple questions, of course, have exceedingly complex answers, and many biological details about the process of memory in humans and other animals remain unknown. hhmi investigator eric r. kandel of columbia university, however, has provided a good start. his studies of the molecular basis of learning and memory underpin much of what we know about how events are recorded by the brain, processed by individual nerve cells, and etched in gray matter. for his work on learning and memory, kandel was awarded a share of the 2000 nobel prize in physiology or medicine. in the 1960s, kandel began his studies of learning and memory by focusing on the behavior of the sea slug aplysia, which he found to be a marvelously tractable system in which to study the cellular basis of these abilities. with only about 20, 000 nerve cells — compared with the roughly thousand billion in humans — and a well - delineated neural circuitry, it proved possible to zero in on a biologically interesting reflex pathway. like humans and other animals, aplysia is capable of learning to modify this reflex, and this learning involves making memories. kandel found that the cellular basis for memory depends on persistent changes
