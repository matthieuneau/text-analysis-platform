excerpt of how to read and why by harold bloom ( page 2 of 5 ) printer friendly excerpt i turn to reading as a solitary praxis, rather than as an educational enterprise. the way we read now, when we are alone with ourselves, retains considerable continuity with the past, however it is performed in the academies. my ideal reader ( and lifelong hero ) is dr. samuel johnson, who knew and expressed both the power and the limitation of incessant reading. like every other activity of the mind, it must satisfy johnson's prime concern, which is with " what comes near to ourself, what we can put to use. " sir francis bacon, who provided some of the ideas that johnson put to use, famously gave the advice : " read not to contradict and confute, nor to believe and take for granted, nor to find talk and discourse, but to weigh and consider. " i add to bacon and johnson a third sage of reading, emerson, fierce enemy of history and of all historicisms, who remarked that the best books " impress us with the conviction, that one nature wrote and the same reads. " let me fuse bacon, johnson, and emerson into a formula of how to read : find what comes near to you that can be put to the use of weighing and considering, and that addresses you as though you share the one nature, free of time's tyranny. pragmatically that means, first find shakespeare, and let him find you. if king lear is fully to find you, then weigh and consider the nature it shares with you ; its closeness to yourself. i do not intend this as an idealism, but as a pragmatism
