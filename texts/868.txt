with the worlds energy needs growing rapidly, can zero - carbon energy options be scaled up enough to make a significant difference? how much of a dent can these alternatives make in the worlds total energy usage over the next half - century? as the mit energy initiative approaches its fifth anniversary next month, this five - part series takes a broad view of the likely scalable energy candidates. of all the zero - carbon energy sources available, wind power is the only one thats truly cost - competitive today : a 2006 report by the u. s. energy information administration put the total cost for wind - produced electricity at an average of $ 55. 80 per megawatt - hour, compared to $ 53. 10 for coal, $ 52. 50 for natural gas and $ 59. 30 for nuclear power. as a result, wind turbines are being deployed rapidly in many parts of the united states and around the world. and because of winds proven record and its immediate and widespread availability, its an energy source thats seen as having the potential to grow very rapidly. wind is probably one of the most significant renewable energy sources, simply because the technology is mature, says paul sclavounos, an mit professor of mechanical engineering and naval architecture. there is no technological risk. globally, 2 percent of electricity now comes from wind, and in some places the rate is much higher : denmark, the present world leader, gets more than 19 percent of its electricity from wind, and is aiming to boost that number to 50 percent. some experts estimate wind power could account for 10 to 20 percent of world electricity generation over the next few decades. taking a longer - term view, a widely cited 2005 study by researchers at stanford university projected that wind, if fully
