date : august 2010 creator : allen, evette l. description : family communication has the potential to affect a variety of youth behavioral outcomes including adolescent sexual risk behavior. within chapter 1, i present past literature on adolescent sexual risk behaviors, family communication patterns, and the gaps associated with those areas. in chapter 2, i review previous literature on adolescent sexual risk behavior, parent - child communication and family communication patterns. in chapter 3, i present the method which includes a description of the participants, procedures, measures, and data analysis used. in chapter 4, i present the results of the study. according to the results of the study, father - child communication is not a better predictor of adolescent sexual risk behavior. a higher quantity of parent - child communication does not lead to less adolescent sexual risk behavior. participants with a pluralistic family type do significantly differ from laissez - faire and protective family types in regards to levels of parent - child communication. participants with a consensual family type do have significantly higher levels of parent - child communication in comparison to laissez - faire family types, but not protective family types. finally, in chapter 5, i present the discussion with a review of previous research ( consistent or inconsistent with the current findings ), limitations and conclusions for the current study. contributing partner : unt libraries
