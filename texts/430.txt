us 4884575 a a cardiac pacemaker pulse generator is adapted to. generate electrical stimuli at a first pacing rate, and to selectively increase the rate to a second higher pacing rate. a timer triggers the rate increase to establish the higher rate as an exercise rate folloing the passage of a preset period of time after the timer is enabled. an external magnet controlled by the patient activates a reed switch to enable the timer to commence timing. the pulse generator is further adapted to respond to a second pass of the magnet over the reed switch after enabling of the timer to thereupon disable the timer before the preset period of time has expired. if the second pass of the magnet occurs after the exercise rate has begun, the element for increasing the rate is disabled to return the pulse generator to the lower pacing rate. the change in pacing rates is made in steps. 1. in combination with an implantable cardiac pacemaker for delivering electrical stimuli to the heart of a patient to pace the heart rate, said pacemaker comprising : pulse generator means for selectively producing said electrical stimuli at a fixed resting rate and at a higher exercise rate, lead means associated with said pulse generator for delivering said stimuli to a selected chamber of the heart, and timer means for stepping - up said pulse generator means from said resting rate to said exercise rate after an adjustable preset delay following activation of said timer means, said preset delay being of a duration perceptible by the patient ; and external control means for patient initiation of a first command to said pacemaker to activate said timer means. 2. in combination with an implantable cardiac pacemaker for delivering electrical stimuli to the heart of a patient to pace the heart rate,
