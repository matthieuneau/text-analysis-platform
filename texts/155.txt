what is it? fertility awareness is a way to prevent pregnancy by not having sex around the time of ovulation ( the release of an egg during a girl's monthly cycle ). couples who do want to have a baby can also use this method to have sex during the time that they are most likely to conceive. fertility awareness can include methods such as natural family planning, periodic abstinence, and the rhythm method. how does it work? if a couple doesn't have sex around the time of ovulation, the girl is less likely to get pregnant. the trick is knowing when ovulation happens. couples use a calendar, a thermometer to measure body temperature, the thickness of cervical mucus, or a kit that tests for ovulation. the ovulation kits are more useful for couples who are trying to get pregnant. the fertile period around ovulation lasts 6 to 9 days and during this time the couple using only fertility awareness for birth control who does not want to get pregnant should not have sex. how well does it work? fertility awareness is not a reliable way to prevent pregnancy for most teens. over the course of 1 year, as many as 25 out of 100 typical couples who rely on fertility awareness to prevent pregnancy will have an accidental pregnancy. of course, this is an average figure, and the chance of getting pregnant depends on whether a couple uses one or more of the fertility awareness methods correctly and consistently and does not have unprotected sex during the fertile period. in general, how well each type of birth control method works depends on a lot of things. these include whether a person has any health conditions, is taking any medications that might interfere with its use
