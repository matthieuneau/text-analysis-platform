flickr as a paintbrush [ cartogrammar. com ] reveals the recorded colors of our surrounding landscape, both in a physical and cultural sense. in short, andy woodruff created a set of geographic heatmaps that represent the average colors of images taken on locations surrounding a specific landmark. in other words, the resulting maps reveal the colors that people on the ground should be looking at. technically, these maps are based on the most recent 2, 000 photos uploaded to flickr that were geotagged within a specified bounding box. these were then averaged by hue. as an emergent result, the color red reveals the dominance of brick, while green / yellow colors naturally denote grass and trees. however, some unexpected patterns appear as well, such as blue / purple in the map of boston.
