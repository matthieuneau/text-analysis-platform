| yoon jae kim, yj1dreamer at gmail. com ( a project report written under the guidance of prof. raj jain ) | | download | service oriented architecture ( soa ) is a design pattern which is composed of loosely coupled, discoverable, reusable, inter - operable platform agnostic services in which each of these services follow a well defined standard. each of these services can be bound or unbound at any time and as needed. [ jamil08 ] however, as defined, soa has a loosely - coupled feature, which makes soa open to the challenges of security. it means that soa must meet several requirements. the main requirements are as follows [ candolin07 ] : service discovery, service authentication, user authentication, access control, confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy. to ensure security in a loosely - coupled soa environment, the open standards communities that created web services developed a number of security standards for web services which is one of the most active and widely adopted implementation of soa. figure 1 depicts a notional reference model for web services security standards. this reference model maps the different standards to the different functional layers of a typical web service implementation. as described above, in the web services security stack the security assertion markup language ( saml ) and the extensible access control markup language ( xacml ) are the standard for access control which means that when the service is requested by a user the service must enforce the specified security policy related to access control. we focus on access control in the web services security and represent what saml and xacml are, how they work and where they are able to be applied together
