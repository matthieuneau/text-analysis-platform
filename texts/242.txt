in my next few blogs, i will provide an overview of voltage source converter ( vsc ) hvdc technology and its suitability for smart grids operation and control discussed. vsc hvdc is based upon transistor technology and was developed in the 1990 ′ s. the switching element is the insulated gate bipolar thyristor ( igbt ), which can be switched on and off by applying a suitable voltage to the gate ( steering electrode ). because of the more switching operations, and the nature of the semiconductor devices itself, the converter losses are generally higher than those of hvdc classic converters. vsc hvdc is commonly used with underground or submarine cables with a transfer capacity in the range of 10 – 1000 mw, and is suitable to serve as a connection to a wind farm or supply a remote load. vsc hvdc technology has very fast steer and control functionality and is suitable for meshed networks. it is characterised by compactness of the converter stations, due to the reduced need for ac harmonic filters and reactive power compensation. power flow reversal in vsc systems is achieved by reversal of the current, whereas in hvdc classic systems the voltage polarity has to change. an important consequence of this voltage source behavior is the ability to use cheaper and easier to install xlpe cables, instead of the mass - impregnated cables that are needed for hvdc classic. currently, only twelve vsc hvdc projects are in service. a few examples include : estlink, which connects estonia to finland ( 350 mw ), and borwin1, connecting an offshore wind farm to northern germany ( 400 mw ). both are equipped with ±150
