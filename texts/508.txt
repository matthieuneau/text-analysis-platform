when you work on introducing a new technology to a population and region, you discover lots of intriguing impediments to that introduction that you ’ d never have imagined. yesterday ( october 11, 2012 ) the maine fuel board voted to allow maine energy systems to engage in an “ emerging technologies ” project with them that might lead to elimination of one of those impediments for the pellet central heating industry in the state of maine. maine is unique in its licensure of technicians for “ solid fuels. ” in maine a person installing a boiler must have “ solid fuel ” authority on his license to legally install a “ solid fuel ” boiler in someone else ’ s building. ( it ’ s a bit more complicated than that, but let ’ s avoid the levels of license detail. ) the need for this rule apparently arose from three potential hazards associated with “ solid fuel ” boilers : the possibility for a thermal run - away during a power outage as combustion continues on a load of fuel while circulation fails due to lack of power, high chimney temperatures, and high boiler surface temperatures. as highly sophisticated automatic pellet boilers made their way into the american market, they were defined in maine as “ solid fuel ” appliances because pellets are solid. while that seems innocent and logical enough, the categorization has one substantial flaw and it creates one significant impediment to product growth in the marketplace. state - of - the - art pellet boilers display none of the attributes that led to the perceived need for “ solid fuel ” rules in maine. the rules were devised for cordwood boilers and coal stoker boilers that can hold a significant charge of fuel at any given time. the combustion of that fuel is relatively un
