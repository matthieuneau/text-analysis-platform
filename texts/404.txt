the energy [ r ] evolution the climate change imperative demands nothing short of an energy [ r ] evolution. the expert consensus is that this fundamental shift must begin immediately and be well underway within the next ten years in order to avert the worst impacts. what is needed is a complete transformation of the way we produce, consume and distribute energy, while at the same time maintaining economic growth. nothing short of such a revolution will enable us to limit global warming to less than a rise in temperature of 2° celsius, above which the impacts become devastating. current electricity generation relies mainly on burning fossil fuels, with their associated co2 emissions, in very large power stations which waste much of their primary input energy. more energy is lost as the power is moved around the electricity grid network and converted from high transmission voltage down to a supply suitable for domestic or commercial consumers. the system is innately vulnerable to disruption : localised technical, weather - related or even deliberately caused faults can quickly cascade, resulting in widespread blackouts. whichever technology is used to generate electricity within this old fashioned configuration, it will inevitably be subject to some, or all, of these problems. at the core of the energy [ r ] evolution there therefore needs to be a change in the way that energy is both produced and distributed. 4. 1 key principles the energy [ r ] evolution can be achieved by adhering to five key principles : 1. respect natural limits – phase out fossil fuels by the end of this century we must learn to respect natural limits. there is only so much carbon that the atmosphere can absorb. each year humans emit over 25 billion tonnes of carbon equivalent ; we are literally filling up the sky. geological resources of coal could provide several hundred years
