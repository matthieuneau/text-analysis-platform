a reading for cultural anthropology by walter trobisch ( adapted from readings in missionary anthropology ii, edited by william smalley. used under the educational " fair use " provision of the 1976 u. s. copyright acts. ) " jesus took the man aside, away from the crowd... and said to him'be opened.'with that his ears were opened, and at the same time the impediment was removed. " ( mark 7 : 33 - 35 ) what we need is a message tailored for each individual. in a concrete situation, general principles alone are not enough. let us therefore take three people aside - - away from the crowd. let us try to help them and take responsibility for them as a congregation. all three of them are real persons. they come from three different african countries, thousands of miles apart, but i shall not tell you from which countries and i have changed their names. they have given me permission to use their cases as an example, so i am not breaking their confidence. joseph is a 26 - year - old teacher at a mission school. i never met him, but we corresponded for almost three years. he wrote me after he had read my book i loved a girl : three years ago i married a 15 year - old person. i have ten years of schooling, my wife only six. god blessed us one year ago with a baby. i purposely did not choose a. girl with a higher level of education, for i intended to educate my wife in order that she become exactly as i wanted her to be in her work and cleanliness, in her whole life. but she does not satisfy me any more with her obedience. she does not do what i command her
