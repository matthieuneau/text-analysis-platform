discrimination against citizens because of their sexual orientation or their youth is just as unfair as discrimination based on race, religion or gender. access to housing, hotels, theaters and restaurants should be equal to all, as a matter of plain fairness. the palm beach county commission recognized this truth in passing an ordinance protecting homosexuals, unmarried couples and young people from discrimination in renting or buying housing and in public accommodations. the ordinance also bans discrimination based on race, religion, gender, ethnic origin or disability, but it was the protection of gays that generated opposition and demands for a countywide referendum on the issue. no other florida county protects homosexuals against housing discrimination. in the 1970s, dade county passed a similar ordinance but it was repealed in a voter referendum after a bitter fight. a broward county effort to revise the human rights law to protect homosexuals is more complicated. the broward law was adopted through the florida legislature, so a revision must get legislative approval and be ratified in a public referendum. palm beach county ` s ordinance passed 4 - 1 ; commissioner ron howard dissented. the other four commissioners demonstrated courage by refusing to buckle under to opponents or to pass the buck to the public in a referendum. commissioners were elected to make tough decisions ; this time they did. the ordinance provides exceptions : a landlord who lives on his property of four or fewer housing units and rents the rest won ` t have to comply. nor will a seasonal resident who rents his home to someone else part of the year and lives in it himself the rest of the time. also exempt are religious organizations that own housing units. those sensible exceptions leave the vast majority of housing covered under the new ordinance. violators will face fines of up to $ 50
