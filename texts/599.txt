gaia theory is a class of scientific models of the geo - biosphere in which life as a whole fosters and maintains suitable conditions for itself by helping to create an environment on earth suitable for its continuity. the first such theory was created by the atmospheric scientist and chemist, sir james lovelock, who developed his hypotheses in the 1960s before formally publishing the concept, first in the new scientist ( february 13, 1975 ) and then in the 1979 book " quest for gaia ". he hypothesized that the living matter of the planet functioned like a single organism and named this self - regulating living system after the greek goddess, gaia, using a suggestion of novelist william golding. gaia " theories " have non - technical predecessors in the ideas of several cultures. today, " gaia theory " is sometimes used among non - scientists to refer to hypotheses of a self - regulating earth that are non - technical but take inspiration from scientific models. among some scientists, " gaia " carries connotations of lack of scientific rigor, quasi - mystical thinking about the planet arth, and therefore lovelock's hypothesis was received initially with much antagonism by much of the scientific community. no controversy exists, however, that life and the physical environment significantly influence one another. gaia theory today is a spectrum of hypotheses, ranging from the undeniable ( weak gaia ) to the radical ( strong gaia ). at one end of this spectrum is the undeniable statement that the organisms on the earth have radically altered its composition. a stronger position is that the earth's biosphere effectively acts as if it is a self - organizing system, which
