by + richard holbrooke – schwann cells boost and amplify nerve growth in animal models, but their clinical use has been held back because they are difficult, time - consuming and costly to culture. a university of sheffield team, led by professor john haycock, has developed a new technique with adult rat tissue which overcomes all these problems, producing schwann cells in less than half the time and at much lower cost. “ the ability of schwann cells to boost nerve growth was proved many years ago in animals, but if you want to use this technique with patients, the problem is : where do you get enough cells from? ” said professor haycock, from the university ’ s department of materials science and engineering. “ to reduce immune rejection, the cells have to be grown from the patient ’ s own tissue. of course, you want to take the smallest amount of tissue necessary, so the technique must be efficient. it must also be fast, so treatment can begin as soon as possible after injury. for clinical use, it must also provide pure schwann cells. and finally, to make it viable, it has to be at a reasonable cost. ” existing methods for growing schwann cells from adult tissue promote the growth of another type of cell, called fibroblasts, which swamp the schwann cells, reducing the speed they grow and their numbers. this means that large amounts of tissue are needed at the outset, to grow sufficient cells for therapeutic use. it also requires extra purification stages added to the process, making it slow and costly – taking up to 3 months to complete. professor haycock and his team have come up with a very simple solution : feed the sc
