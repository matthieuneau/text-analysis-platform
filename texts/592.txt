the weekly newsmagazine of science volume 155, number 19 ( may 8, 1999 ) | < < back to contents | by j. raloff canadian scientists have identified the likely culprit behind some historic, regional declines in atlantic salmon. the researchers find that a near - ubiquitous water pollutant can render young, migrating fish unable to survive a life at sea. heavy, late - spring spraying of forests with a pesticide laced with nonylphenol during the 1970s and'80s was the clue that led the biologists to unmask that chemical's role in the transitory decline of salmon in east canada. though these sprays have ended, concentrations of nonylphenols in forest runoff then were comparable to those in the effluent of some pulp mills, industrial facilities, and sewage - treatment plants today. downstream of such areas, the scientists argue, salmon and other migratory fish may still be at risk. nonylphenols are surfactants used in products from pesticides to dishwashing detergents, cosmetics, plastics, and spermicides. because waste - treatment plants don't remove nonylphenols well, these chemicals can build up in downstream waters ( sn : 1 / 8 / 94, p. 24 ). when british studies linked ambient nonylphenol pollution to reproductive problems in fish ( sn : 2 / 26 / 94, p. 142 ), wayne l. fairchild of canada's department of fisheries and oceans in moncton, new brunswick, became concerned. he recalled that an insecticide used on local forests for more than a decade had contained large amounts of nonylphenols. they helped aminocarb
