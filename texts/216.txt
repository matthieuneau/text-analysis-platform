may 16, 2011 if you fuel your truck with biodiesel made from palm oil grown on a patch of cleared rainforest, you could be putting into the atmosphere 10 times more greenhouse gasses than if you ’ d used conventional fossil fuels. it ’ s a scenario so ugly that, in its worst case, it makes even diesel created from coal ( the “ coal to liquids ” fuel dreaded by climate campaigners the world over ) look “ green. ” the biggest factor determining whether or not a biofuel ultimately leads to more greenhouse - gas emissions than conventional fossil fuels is the type of land used to grow it, says a new study from researchers at mit. the carbon released when you clear a patch of rainforest is the reason that palm oil grown on that patch of land leads to 55 times the greenhouse - gas emissions of palm oil grown on land that had already been cleared or was not located in a rainforest, said the study ’ s lead author. the solution to this biofuels dilemma is more research. unlike solar and wind, it ’ s truly an area in which the world is desperate for scientific breakthroughs, such as biofuels from algae or salt - tolerant salicornia.
