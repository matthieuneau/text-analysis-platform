science fair project encyclopedia the chloride ion is formed when the element chlorine picks up one electron to form the anion ( negatively charged ion ) cl−. the salts of hydrochloric acid hcl contain chloride ions and are also called chlorides. an example is table salt, which is sodium chloride with the chemical formula nacl. in water, it dissolves into na + and cl− ions. the word chloride can also refer to a chemical compound in which one or more chlorine atoms are covalently bonded in the molecule. this means that chlorides can be either inorganic or organic compounds. the simplest example of an inorganic covalently bonded chloride is hydrogen chloride, hcl. a simple example of an organic covalently bonded chloride is chloromethane ( ch3cl ), often called methyl chloride. other examples of inorganic covalently bonded chlorides which are used as reactants are : - phosphorus trichloride, phosphorus pentachloride, and thionyl chloride - all three are reactive chlorinating reagents which have been used in a laboratory. - disulfur dichloride ( scl2 ) - used for vulcanization of rubber. chloride ions have important physiological roles. for instance, in the central nervous system the inhibitory action of glycine and some of the action of gaba relies on the entry of cl− into specific neurons. the contents of this article is licensed from www. wikipedia. org under the gnu free documentation license. click here to see the transparent copy and copyright details
