i ’ ve seen several articles debating when oil production will peak. for those of you who have missed them, oil prices rise due to scarcity ( real or not ) or increased production costs, and the latter become important sometime around when oil production peaks. also, the time for us to go through the second half of the world ’ s oil will be considerably less than the history of oil use to date, and our transportation infrastructure in particular is heavily oil - based. among climate change scientists, there seems to be less worry about running out of oil, and considerably more worry about its use. recent readings have given me some understanding. david greene, et al, from ( pdf file ) running out of and into oil : analyzing global oil depletion and transition through 2050 “ it is possible that the world could go partway down the path of developing unconventional oil resources and later reverse direction. but such a strategy would strand huge investments in the more capital - intensive production and refining of unconventional oil. if the transition to unconventional oil is gradual, there might be time to introduce low - carbon alternatives and a reversal might not be too costly. but if the transition to unconventional oil is sudden and massive, the world ’ s economies might quickly become locked into a high carbon future. avoiding or even slowing the transition to unconventional fossil resources might improve the world ’ s chances of successfully dealing with global climate change. ” the unconventional oil sources referred to are coal to liquids ( synfuel ), for example, or natural gas to liquids ( isn ’ t all natural gas needed for electricity and heating? ) both increase carbon emissions, in part because of the energy needed to convert them to liquid. both are expensive because they require so much energy for
