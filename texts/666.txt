robb godshaw, from syynlabs, has created a haptic cube that gives you an impression of what the temperature will be like tomorrow. the cube, which godshaw has named the cryoscope, consists of an aluminium shell surrounding a peltier element, heatsink, cooling fan and an led, all controlled by an arduino. the cube is heated to a " neutral " state of 30c, and then adjusted by the number of degrees that the next day's forecast differs from room temperature ( 23c ). it takes into account wind chill and humidity to give an idea what the following day will " feel " like, rather than merely reflecting air temperature. so, for example, if the forecast for the next day is for 18c, once those factors are all taken into account, the cube's temperature will decrease five degrees from 30c to 25c, resulting in it being slightly cool to the touch. godshaw describes it in the video above as a " haptic weathervane ", adding : " users enter their location into a web app. the cube then automatically adjusts to the forecasted temperature. by touching the cryoscope, the user is able to feel tomorrow's air you can see the cryoscope in action over on godshaw's website. updated 08 : 29 09 / 05 / 2012 : godshaw has redesigned the cryoscope and is raising money for full production over on kickstarter.
