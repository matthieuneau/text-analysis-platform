buildings don ’ t work they way they used to. 1 folks are always saying stuff like this. but let me make the case regarding just one factor and you decide. there are other factors of course, but i want to focus on only one for the moment. this one over - arching factor is the amount of energy exchange across the building enclosure. i think that higher levels of thermal resistance and reduced heat gain across building enclosures has forever changed the performance of buildings — and not necessarily in a good way. and things are going to get worse before they get better. sound familiar? the lens i am going to use to look at this factor is moisture. why? it is one of the principal damage functions acting on materials along with heat and ultra - violet radiation. 2 i think moisture is the key to understanding the performance of buildings in general — and in this particular case — in specific. the consequence of this reduced energy exchange is beginning to be seen all over the place : mold, part load humidity problems, rot, and corrosion. highly insulated building enclosures with reduced heat gain have low drying potentials and increased interior moisture loads. when they get wet they don ’ t dry. stuff is beginning to stink, rot, break and annoy. there are two things to look at here. levels of insulation and airtight assemblies and heat gain through glazing, roof assemblies and interior loads. adding insulation and providing airtight assemblies reduces energy flow. that is a good thing right? well, no — not always. less energy flow from the inside to the outside the colder things on the outside of the building get in the winter. the colder these things, the wetter these things get and the wetter they stay.
