date : december 2004 creator : habel, agnieszka description : this problem in lieu of thesis is a discussion of two topics : brownian movement and quantum computers. brownian movement is a physical phenomenon in which the particle velocity is constantly undergoing random fluctuations. chapters 2, 3 and 4, describe brownian motion from three different perspectives. the next four chapters are devoted to the subject of quantum computers, which are the signal of a new era of technology and science combined together. in the first chapter i present to a reader the two topics of my problem in lieu of thesis. in the second chapter i explain the idea of brownian motion, its interpretation as a stochastic process and i find its distribution function. the next chapter illustrates the probabilistic picture of brownian motion, where the statistical averages over trajectories are related to the probability distribution function. chapter 4 shows how to derive the langevin equation, introduced in chapter 1, using a hamiltonian picture of a bath with infinite number of harmonic oscillators. the chapter 5 explains how the idea of quantum computers was developed and how step - by - step all the puzzles for the field of quantum computers were created. the next chapter, chapter 6, discus the basic quantum unit of information... contributing partner : unt libraries
