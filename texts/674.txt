why is my paper pink? the color of today ’ s paper is probably quite a shock to many of our readers, and that is just the effect we are hoping for. today marks the beginning of breast cancer awareness month, and this edition of the yazoo herald is dedicated to raising awareness about the importance of early detection and encouraging support for efforts to help find a cure. most of us know someone who has been affected by breast cancer. besides some forms of skin cancer, it is the most common cancer in women. it doesn ’ t discriminate. breast cancer rates are equally high among women of all races. the center of disease control reports that it is the highest cause of death by cancer among hispanic women and the second - leading cancer cause of death among white and black women. one in eight women in the united states will suffer from invasive breast cancer at some point in their lives. fortunately, breast cancer deaths have been decreasing since 1990 as detection and treatment improve, reducing the mortality rate to 3 in 100. if you ’ re reading this and you haven ’ t had an examination, it ’ s time to make an appointment. last updated ( friday, 30 september 2011 18 : 19 )
