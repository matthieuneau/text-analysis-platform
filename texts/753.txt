you wouldn ’ t guess that a bit of green slime could do so much. but from from food to fuel, petroalgae, inc. seems to have thought of everything. this florida - based renewable energy company has developed a technology in which algae and other microorganisms produce fuel to feed cars, animals, and even humans... and say they can do it cheaper than anyone else. with the addition of a few basic nutrients, algae gather most of their energy from the sun. the result is a protein and carbohydrate - rich slime that can be converted to a variety of products. first, the protein is extracted and processed into animal feed or blended into human food products. petroalgae actually lists one of its products as “ meal replacer ”, conjuring images of our new utopian future in which chewing is obsolete. after the protein extraction, what remains is a “ lipid - carbohydrate mash ”. petroalgae claims that this material can be sent directly to a petroleum refinery and processed into diesel, gas, or jet fuel without the need to retro - fit any of the refinery ’ s conventional equipment. algae cultivation requires very little square - footage relative to conventional crops, can be grown on non - arable land, and consumes up to twice its weight in carbon dioxide as it grows. in addition to algae, petroalgae draws from a large pool of microorganisms including diatoms, cyanobacteria, and micro - angiosperms ( tiny flowering plants ). while exact species remain unnamed, the company conscientiously notes that they use only species indigenous to the
