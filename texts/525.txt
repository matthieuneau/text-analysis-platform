with a deer, you would never grab the bull by the horns. for a few good reasons : male deer are not called bulls, they are bucks, and they do not have horns, only antlers. antlers and horns are two distinctly different accessories. horns are hollow and are held atop the head of members of the bovid family. bovids include cows, sheep, bison and goats. horns grow continuously year - round and are covered in keratin. they do not usually branch and are found on both male and female bovids. antlers, on the other hand, are temporary bones found on the heads of members of the cervid family. cervids include deer, moose, elk, caribou and others. antlers are temporary, often branching structures, growing generally on males for only part of the year. after eight months of growth and development, antlers will drop off the animal ’ s head. these cranial appendages are covered with a soft skin called velvet, which supplies blood, oxygen and nutrients to the growing antler bone. it is this velvet that will be rubbed against trees during mating, or rutting season in december. it is not only form, but function that is different for these two toppers. horns mainly protect the skull, while antlers are for communicating, to establish dominance, and for seducing members of the opposite sex. seduction is accomplished by the antlers because the velvet covering and the animal ’ s head contain the highest concentration of oil and scent - producing glands that will attract the fairer sex. size matters when it comes to antlers. bigger is better — a nice rack can be up to nine pounds and spread to 25
