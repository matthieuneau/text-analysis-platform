the immune system because the human body provides an ideal environment for many microbes, they try to pass your skin barrier and enter. your immune system is a bodywide network of cells, tissues, and organs that has evolved to defend you against such " foreign " invasions. the proper targets of your immune system are infectious organisms - - bacteria such as these streptococci ; fungi ( this one happens to be candida, the cause of yeast infections ) ; parasites, including these worm - like microbes that cause malaria ; and viruses such as this sars virus. markers of self at the heart of the immune response is the ability to distinguish between " self " and " non - self. " every cell in your body carries the same set of distinctive surface proteins that distinguish you as " self. " normally your immune cells do not attack your own body tissues, which all carry the same pattern of self - markers ; rather, your immune system coexists peaceably with your other body cells in a state known as self - tolerance. this set of unique markers on human cells is called the major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ). there are two classes : mhc class i proteins, which are on all cells, and mhc class ii proteins, which are only on certain specialized cells. markers of non - self any non - self substance capable of triggering an immune response is known as an antigen. an antigen can be a whole non - self cell, a bacterium, a virus, an mhc marker protein or even a portion of a protein from a foreign organism. the distinctive markers on antigens that trigger an immune response are called epitopes. when tissues or cells from another individual enter your body carrying
