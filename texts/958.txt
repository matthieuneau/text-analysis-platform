are omega - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids derived from food sources other than fish as effective as the ones that are derived from fish? in a recent review in the journal of lipid research, researchers from oregon state university set out to assess the scientific data we have available to answer that question. the review article by donald b. jump, christopher m. depner and sasmita tripathy was part of a thematic series geared toward identifying new lipid and lipoprotein targets for the treatment of cardiometabolic diseases. interest in the health benefits of omega - 3 pufa stemmed from epidemiological studies on greenland inuits in the 1970s that linked reduced rates of myocardial infarction ( compared with rates among western populations ) to a high dietary intake of fish - derived omega - 3 pufa. those studies have spurred hundreds of others attempting to unravel the effects of omega - 3 pufa on cardiovascular disease and its risk factors. | the omega - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( pufa ) conversion pathway. omega - 3 in the diet fish - derived sources of omega - 3 pufa are eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. these fatty acids can be found in nutritional supplements and foods such as salmon, anchovies and sardines. plant - derived sources of omega - 3 pufa are alpha - linolenic acid and stearidonic acid. alpha - linolenic acid is an essential fatty acid. it cannot be synthesized in the body, so it is necessary to get it from dietary sources, such as flaxseed, walnuts, canola
