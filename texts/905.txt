it's easy at first glance to envision the caribbean islands as all being the same sunny, sandy vacation destinations, but they are different in as many ways as they are similar. just as political and economic factors determine the personality of the islands, so do various landforms that may, or may not, be shared from island to island. the islands of the caribbean, like all other islands, have water that surrounds them on every side. individual islands and groups of islands belong to various nations. puerto rico and the american virgin islands belong to the united states. among the territories of britain are bermuda and the british virgin islands. the islands range widely in size, with cuba being the largest, followed by hispaniola and jamaica. many of the smaller islands are uninhabited. some of the uninhabited islands, such as the isla de ratones just off the shore of puerto rico, are available for day trips and are reached by ferries, boats or kayaks. the larger islands of the caribbean have enough land space to support rivers. hispaniola has four primary rivers : yaque del norte, yuna river, yaque del sur and the artibonite river. cuba's important rivers are the rio cauto, which is the longest, rio almendares and rio yurimi. smaller rivers contribute to these three main rivers. the grande de arecibo is puerto rico's longest river. this river, along with several others such as the cibuco, loiza and la plata, run north. one river runs westward : the grande de anasco. the bahamas have no rivers. many of the caribbean islands have mountainous areas. most of puerto rico's mountains are located on the island's interior
