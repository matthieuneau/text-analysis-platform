this is a great activity that goes with the new book in the sir cumference series. the book is titled sir cumference and the viking's map. it is a story that correlates with coordinate graphing. the activity i made to go along with the book is a " map " graph and a set of ten sentences that have students mark an x at each of the stops ( coordinate points ). this is a great way to tie reading into your math lesson or math into a reading lesson.
