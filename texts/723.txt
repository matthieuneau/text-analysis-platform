combined gas law the combined gas law combines charles law, boyle s law and gay lussac s law. the combined gas law states that a gas pressure x volume x temperature = constant. alright. in class you should have learned about the three different gas laws. the first one being boyle's law and it talks about the relationship between pressure and volume of a particular gas. the next one should be charles law which talks about the volume and temperature of a particular gas. and the last one should be gay lussac's law which talks about the relationship between pressure and temperature of a particular gas. okay. but what happens when you have pressure, volume and temperature all changing? well, we're actually going to combine these gas laws to form one giant gas law called the combined gas law. okay. if you notice then these three gas laws the pressure and volume are always in the numerator. so we're going to keep them on the numerator. p1v1. and notice the temperature is in the denominator over t1. so all these things are just squished into one and then p2v2 over t2. okay. so this is what we're going to call the combined gas law. so let's actually get an example and do one together. alright, so i have a problem up here that says a gas at 110 kilo pascals and 33 celsius fills a flexible container with an initial volume of two litres, okay? if the temperature is raised to 80 degrees celsius and the pressure is raised to 440 kilo pascals, what is the new volume? okay. so notice we have three variables. we're talking
