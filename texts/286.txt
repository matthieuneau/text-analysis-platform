first, an object is placed on the platform of the printer upon – a petrie dish for example. then the printer must check the height of the object to make sure everything is calibrated correctly. mr. carvalho placed a paper card on the platform of the 3d - bioplotter to demonstrate how the machine works. mr. carvalho then talked us through the printing process. to begin, a liquefied material – in this case a silicone paste – is pressed through a needle - like tip by applying air pressure. the needle moves in all three dimensions which means it is able to create a three dimensional object. the printer is called ‘ bioplotter ’ because the unique aspect of this machine is its use of biomaterials to make implants or other objects for biomedical application. some of the implants which are made using the 3d bioplotter are intended to dissolve in the body. the materials which are used in this application include plla, plga, and silicone. implants made with thermoplastics – as they are mostly water and co2 – are removed by the body naturally in around a week or two. other materials, such as ceramic paste, may also be used to print implants. the implants printed using ceramic paste do not dissolve. instead, the body uses this material to create new bone. this actually speeds up the process of the body ’ s regeneration. the 3dbioplotter also prints hydrogels – such as collagen or alginate. these materials can have human cells actually added to them. thus human cells may be printed directly with this machine. every thursday is # 3dthursday here at ada
