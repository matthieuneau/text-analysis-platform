aliphatic alcohols occur naturally in free form ( component of the cuticular lipids ) but more usually in esterified ( wax esters ) or etherified form ( glyceryl ethers ). several alcohols belong to aroma compounds which are found in environmental or food systems ( see the website : flavornet ). they are found with normal, branched ( mono - or isoprenoid ), saturated or unsaturated of various chain length and sometimes with secondary or even tertiary alcoholic function. an unusual phenolic alcohol is found as a component of glycolipids in mycobacteria. some cyclic alcohols have been described in plants. a classification according to the carbon - chain structure is given below. 1 - normal - chain alcohols the carbon chain may be fully saturated or unsaturated ( with double and / or triple bonds ), it may also be substituted with chlorine, bromine or sulfate groups. some acetylenic alcohols have been also described. among the most common, some are listed below 9 - methyl - 1 - hendecanol ( anteisolauryl alcohol ) 11 - methyl - 1 - tridecanol ( anteisomyristyl alcohol ) 14 - methyl - 1 - pentadecanol ( isopalmityl alcohol ) 13 - methyl - 1 - pentadecanol ( anteisopalmityl alcohol ) 16 - methyl - 1 - heptadecanol ( isostearyl alcohol ) 15 - methyl - 1 - pentadecanol ( anteisostearyl alcohol ) free fatty alcohols are not commonly found in epicuticular lipids of insects, although high molecular weight
