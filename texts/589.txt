june 22, 2010 millions of years before humans began battling it out over beachfront property, a similar phenomenon was unfolding in a diverse group of island lizards. often mistaken for chameleons or geckos, anolis lizards fight fiercely for resources, responding to rivals by doing push - ups and puffing out their throat pouches. but anoles also compete in ways that shape their bodies over evolutionary time, says a new study in the journal evolution. anolis lizards colonized the caribbean from south america some 40 million years ago and quickly evolved a wide range of shapes and sizes. " when anoles first arrived in the islands there were no other lizards quite like them, so there was abundant opportunity to diversify, " said author luke mahler of harvard university. free from rivals in their new island homes, anolis lizards evolved differences in leg length, body size, and other characteristics as they adapted to different habitats. today, the islands of cuba, hispaniola, jamaica and puerto rico - - collectively known as the greater antilles - - are home to more than 100 anolis species, ranging from lanky lizards that perch in bushes, to stocky, long - legged lizards that live on tree trunks, to foot - long'giants'that roam the upper branches of trees. " each body type is specialized for using different parts of a tree or bush, " said mahler. alongside researchers from the university of rochester, harvard university, and the national evolutionary synthesis center, mahler wanted to understand how and when this wide range of shapes and sizes came to be. to do that, the team used dna and body measurements from species living today to reconstruct how they evolved in the past. in addition to
