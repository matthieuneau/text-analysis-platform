common streaming audio formats and players uncompressed cd - quality wav and aiff files are too large to stream over the internet for playback in real time. instead, lighter - weight compressed formats such as mp3 and realaudio are employed for streaming network audio. these formats use what are called " lossy " compression schemes, reducing file sizes by eliminating certain inaudible data from the original files without too significantly degrading playback sound quality. mp3 and realaudio are excellent streaming formats, achieving performance factors great enough to allow real - time encoding / decoding over current network bandwidth conditions while delivering satisfying audio quality. mp3 and realaudio are not the only players in the network streaming audio arena. we'll also look at macromedia's flash and the ogg vorbis project from the xiphophorus group. since realaudio's internet history begins the earliest, we'll start with realaudio. in 1995, progressive networks ( now realnetworks ) introduced realaudio, the internet's first widely - deployed streaming audio format. the realaudio player ( realplayer ) was freely distributed to users who at that time were typically connected to the internet via low - bandwidth modems ; thus, the player supported connection rates as low as 14. 4 kbps, which delivered audio quality comparable to the sound of a decent am radio. faster connections such as isdn accordingly improved reception speed and sound quality. by giving away basic versions of realplayer and the realproducer content - production utility, progressive networks seeded the market for their commercial product line and sparked an explosion in network multimedia. today you can find an astonishing number and variety of realaudio -
