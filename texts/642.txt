tell me about the international dark - sky association — how did it start, what's the mission? ida ’ s mission is to preserve and protect the nighttime environment and our heritage of dark skies through environmentally responsible outdoor lighting. ida was founded in 1988 by a professional astronomer working at the kitt peak observatory in tucson, arizona and an amateur astronomer who noticed that the increasing sky glow over tucson was interfering with nighttime observations. their message is simple, clear, and effective, and their efforts were fundamental in getting light pollution recognized around the world as an unwelcome and detrimental environmental condition. what are some of the effects of light pollution on animals? on humans? tell me about some of the science that supports this. there are four main types of light pollution : sky glow ( that strange orange dome over urban areas ), glare ( overly bright, unshielded points of light ), light trespass ( unwanted light intruding onto private property ), and clutter ( groupings of light sources ). animals and even plants are affected by sky glow and light trespass due to their extreme photosensitivity. because seasonal temperatures can vary from year to year, many species rely on light cues to tell them when to shed leaves, mate, and reproduce. when outdoor lighting artificially prolongs the day, the instinctive rhythms of many species are affected. many species behave unnaturally in the presence of artificial light — for example, light at night decreases a firefly ’ s ability to be seen, thereby hindering its ability to attract a mate. sea turtles and migratory birds use starlight to orient themselves, so light pollution has devastated their internal navigation systems. some birds will crash into tall buildings, or fixate
