not just for kids the hunt for falling leaves... nature's color on the ground by mary catherine ball being a reporter, i am always looking for an adventure. last week, i found one. i left work to go on a simple journey, but it turned out to be much more. first, i crossed a mud - ridden stream. then, i came face to face with flying creatures, fighting to get near me. i even endured webmakers spinning my hair into a shiny maze. where did i go? into the woods, of course. why? i wanted to gather some fallen leaves. my luck was good that day. i was able to spy lots of different kinds of leaves lying on the ground. some were leaves i had never seen. some were still green, while others were changing to their autumn colors. have you ever hunted for leaves? i wonder if you know the names of five of the trees that live in your neighborhood? i bet the answer is no. well, me neither. so i had five of the leaves analyzed. i had found the leaves from an oak, a beech, a sweet gum tree and more. now, i invite you to make this journey. narrow body with pointy edges narrow body with pointy edges may grow berries good for sap & color 3 distinct leafs may grow nuts this is your task... travel to the deep, dark woods ( in the daylight ) to find these 5 leaves. cut out the page and take it with you. make sure you can match your discovery with mine. happy leaf - hunting! stone soup october 9 ( 11 : 30am ) - enjoy lunch and a show. after you eat peanut butter & jelly, watch stone soup,
