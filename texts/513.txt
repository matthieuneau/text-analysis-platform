the following information was extracted from the publication " threatened " produced by bnz in cooperation with the department of conservation and royal forest and bird protection society. the predation threat in 1987, a dog was on the loose in waitangi state forest in the bay of islands. for six weeks it rampaged through the forest killing every kiwi it encountered. by the time the dog was found, perhaps as many as 500 of the 1000 kiwi living there had been slaughtered. this carnage at waitangi illustrates just how vulnerable the kiwi is to predators and the speed at which seemingly healthy populations can fail. other predators introduced to new zealand by humans may cause similar havoc. the main threat to the kiwi is posed by : possums, stoats, ferrets, and feral ( wild ) cats who steal eggs and kill young. larger predators include pigs and dogs. young kiwi leave the nest at just three weeks of age, weighing only 200g. small and slow, they are easy prey. very few survive this precarious journey from birth to 12 months, when they reach the critical size that enables them to stand up to most predators. humans, primarily through destroying forests and introducing predators in the first place, pose the single greatest threat to the kiwi. ironically, we are also their greatest hope. the kiwi is a one - off evolutionary design, holding all sorts of biological records. new zealand's ancient isolation and lack of mammals allowed it to occupy a habitat and lifestyle that everywhere else in the world would be occupied by a mammal. whereas birds traditionally depend on sight, the kiwi is one of the few birds with a highly developed sense of smell. you can sometimes hear them sniffing around
