by justin moyer the washington post â€” defense secretary leon panetta signed an order thursday allowing women the same opportunities as men to serve in combat, including formerly off - limits assignments on attack submarines and in the navy seals. just two weeks before the announcement, researchers from san diego's naval health research center published a study suggesting that some recent mothers deployed on the battlefield may be more prone to depression after seeing action. " women who deploy and report combat - associated exposures after childbirth are significantly more likely to screen positive for maternal depression than are women who did not deploy after childbirth, " concluded the study, titled " is military deployment a risk factor for maternal depression? " and appearing in the journal of women's health. " it is also possible, " the report noted, " that giving birth and leaving a young child, in addition to the experience of combat, contribute to postdeployment depression. " the study included eight co - authors, five of them associated with the naval health research center, a research and development laboratory within the department of defense. it was based on surveys of more than 1, 600 women who " gave birth during active duty service. " not all branches of the armed forces showed the same results. " participants who served in the army had an increased risk of maternal depression ; army service members tend to be deployed longer and more frequently than personnel serving in the navy and air force, " the study found. of course, you don't have to be a mom to experience depression on the front line. the report points out that " the increased rate of depression is primarily attributed to experiencing combat while deployed, " not just to whether a solider is also a parent.
