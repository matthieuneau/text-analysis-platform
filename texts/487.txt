mary anne dunkin louise chang, md two decades ago, if you had moderate to severe crohn's, there were few treatment options. in the late 1990s, however, the first in a new class of treatment options emerged for crohn's disease. referred to as biologic response modifiers, biologic agents, or simply biologics, these drugs target specific parts of an overactive immune system to reduce inflammation. biologics not only relieve crohn's symptoms but also can bring about remission and keep you in remission. they are indicated for use when someone has moderately to severely active crohn ’ s disease and has not responded well to other crohn ’ s disease treatments. many people with crohn's now live with significantly fewer symptoms, but may worry about side effects. here's a look at the risks and benefits of biologics. in crohn's disease, an overactive immune system causes inflammation and damage to the digestive tract. made from living organisms, biologics work just like substances made by the body ’ s immune system and can help control the immune system response. four biologics are fda approved for crohn's. three of the four block a protein called tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) that's involved in inflammation. these drugs are often called anti - tnf drugs or tnf inhibitors. they include cimzia ( certolizumab ), humira ( adalimumab ), and remicade ( infliximab ). the fourth medication, tysabri ( natalizumab ), is called an integrin receptor antagonist. it
