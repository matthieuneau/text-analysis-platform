at nida's last drug facts chat day, razorfang asked this question : " can you get viruses from drugs? " the answer to this might surprise you. although you can't get viruses directly from drugs, using drugs can increase your chances of catching a virus like hiv ( the virus that causes aids ). in fact, behaviors associated with drug abuse are one of the biggest factors in the spread of hiv across the us. that's because drugs can mess up your judgment and lead to bad decisions â€” bad decisions like unsafe sex. and risky sex can lead to more than pregnancy. it can also lead to becoming infected with hiv or other sexually transmitted viruses.
