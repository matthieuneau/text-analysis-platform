a nuzzle of the neck, a stroke of the wrist, a brush of the knee — these caresses often signal a loving touch, but can also feel highly aversive, depending on who is delivering the touch, and to whom. interested in how the brain makes connections between touch and emotion, neuroscientists at the california institute of technology ( caltech ) have discovered that the association begins in the brain ’ s primary somatosensory cortex, a region that, until now, was thought only to respond to basic touch, not to its emotional quality. “ we demonstrated for the first time that the primary somatosensory cortex — the brain region encoding basic touch properties such as how rough or smooth an object is — also is sensitive to the social meaning of a touch, ” explains michael spezio, a visiting associate at caltech who is also an assistant professor of psychology at scripps college in claremont, california. “ it was generally thought that there are separate brain pathways for how we process the physical aspects of touch on the skin and for how we interpret that touch emotionally — that is, whether we feel it as pleasant, unpleasant, desired, or repulsive. our study shows that, to the contrary, emotion is involved at the primary stages of social touch. ”
