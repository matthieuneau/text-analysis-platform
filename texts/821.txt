research finds novel airborne germ - killing oral spray effective in fighting colds and flu university hospitals case medical center clinical researchers will present findings about a one - two punch to prevent colds and flu in san francisco at the interscience conference on antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy ( icaac ) on september 9, 2012. the research team is presenting data in two poster presentations that a new oral antiseptic spray is effective in killing 99. 9 percent of infectious airborne germs. findings from these two presentations led to the development of halo oral antiseptic, a first - of - its kind germ - fighting spray which is currently on store shelves. " respiratory tract disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world, " says frank esper, md, infectious disease expert at uh rainbow babies & children's hospital and lead author of one of the studies. " yet there has been limited progress in the prevention of respiratory virus infections. halo is unique in that it offers protection from airborne germs such as influenza and rhinovirus. " dr. esper and a team of researchers used glycerine and xanthan gum as a microbial barrier combined with cetylpyridinium chloride ( cpc ) as a broad - spectrum anti - infective agent to fight respiratory illnesses. to test this, clinical strains of 2009 pandemic h1n1 were used as a prototype virus to demonstrate halo's anti - infective activity in cell culture assays. " the glycerine and xanthan gum prevent the germs from entering a person's system and the cpc kills the germs once they're trapped there, " explains
