what is bone cancer? bone is the framework that supports the body. most bones are hollow. bone marrow is the soft tissue inside hollow bones. the main substance of bone is made up of a network of fibrous tissue onto which calcium salts are laid down. this makes the bone very hard and strong. at each end of the bone is a softer bone - like tissue called cartilage that acts as a cushion between bones. the outside of the bone is covered with a layer of fibrous tissue. the bone itself contains 2 kinds of cells. osteoblasts are cells that form the bone. osteoclasts are cells that dissolve bone. although we think that bone does not change, the truth is that it is very active. new bone is always forming and old bone dissolving. the marrow of some bones is only fatty tissue. in other bones the marrow is a mixture of fat cells and the cells that make blood cells. these blood - forming cells make red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. types of bone tumors most of the time when someone is told they have cancer in their bones, the doctor is talking about a cancer that started somewhere else and then spread to the bone. this is called metastatic cancer ( not bone cancer ). this can happen to people with many different types of advanced cancer, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and many others. under a microscope, theses cancer cells in the bone look like the cancer cells that they came from. if someone has lung cancer that has spread to the bone, the cells there will look and act like lung cancer cells and they will be treated the same way. to learn more about cancer that
