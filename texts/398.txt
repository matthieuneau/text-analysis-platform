german military use laser to destroy targets over half - a - mile away high - energy laser passes various tests with germany - based rheinmetall defense has demonstrated a 50kw, high - energy laser at their ground facility in switzerland. according to representatives from the company, the device passed all target tests with “ flying high - energy laser system designed by while we ’ re still a bit away from the sort of shootouts we see in popular science - fiction flicks, the demonstration of this sort of weaponry is impressive how it works the rheinmetall laser system isn ’ t a single laser ; rather, it ’ s composed of two separate laser modules mounted on a revolver gun air defense turrets and attached to additional power modules. the laser modules themselves are 30kw and 20kw, respectively, and a beam superimposing technology combines them, focusing the lights ’ energy in a “ superimposed, cumulative manner ” for the sole purpose of obliterating its target ( s ). in one test, the laser system sliced through a half - inch thick steel girder from a little more than a half - mile away. next, from a distance of approximately one - and - a - quarter miles, the system shot down a bunch of drones as they nose - dived toward the surface at a rate of 50m / s. specific to this test, the system ’ s radar was able to actually track the drones through their descent at a distance of two and a half miles. the last test the system performed was perhaps its most impressive. the weapon was able to focus in on and destroy a steel ball with an 82mm diameter traveling at 50m / s. beyond demonstrating a high level of accuracy, the
