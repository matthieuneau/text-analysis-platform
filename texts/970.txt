put simply, a credit card provides a short - term loan from a bank that you are expected to repay quickly. in exchange for giving you a short - term loan, the bank will charge you interest — often referred to as an annual percentage rate or apr. an issuing bank will evaluate your credit - worthiness and determine if you are a low risk candidate ( likely to repay ) or a high risk candidate ( unlikely to repay ) for a line of credit, and will offer you an apr based on your credit report and how it profiles you financially. some banks will offer you a “ teaser ” apr — essentially a low introductory rate that will change to a higher apr six or more months later. we'll provide some guidance about this concept below.
