the oregon trail opened the way west for intrepid settlers and enterprising miners. once it was well established and the roads were cleared and expanded, once towns had grown up along the route and locations in the rockies and further west were settled, it was only natural that a new method of transportation would take over : stagecoaches. the technology behind stagecoaches wasn ’ t new. carriages were the primary form of mass transportation in the pre - locomotive age. what made stagecoaches different from regular carriages were their size and the way they were supported on the wheel frame. rather than relying on springs, which jostled a rider up and down, stagecoaches made use of thoroughbraces, leather straps that supported the body of the stagecoach and gave it more of a rocking motion. stagecoaches could generally fit nine passengers inside and six outside. inside, as you can probably guess, meant that passengers traveled inside the body of the coach. they would ride on three benches, two facing forward and the foremost one facing backwards, three riders to a bench. as you can imagine, it was a tight squeeze. passengers in the first two benches would often have to wedge their knees between one another to make room. they would carry their baggage and often have mail under their feet. but if that wasn ’ t bad enough, the six passengers riding outside of the carriage would be just as cramped and exposed to the elements. but what passengers lost in comfort, they made up for in speed. the most common type of stagecoach was the concord stagecoach, manufactured in concord, new hampshire. these stagecoaches rarely broke down. they were drawn by a team of six horses and could cut through the new roadways of the west much faster than any wagon train
