real form ( lie theory ) in mathematics, the notion of a real form relates objects defined over the field of real and complex numbers. a real lie algebra g0 is called a real form of a complex lie algebra g if g is the complexification of g0 : real forms for lie groups and algebraic groups using the lie correspondence between lie groups and lie algebras, the notion of a real form can be defined for lie groups. in the case of linear algebraic groups, the notions of complexification and real form have a natural description in the language of algebraic geometry. just as complex semisimple lie algebras are classified by dynkin diagrams, the real forms of a semisimple lie algebra are classified by satake diagrams, which are obtained from the dynkin diagram of the complex form by labeling some vertices black ( filled ), and connecting some other vertices in pairs by arrows, according to certain rules. it is a basic fact in the structure theory of complex semisimple lie algebras that every such algebra has two special real forms : one is the compact real form and corresponds to a compact lie group under the lie correspondence ( its satake diagram has all vertices blackened ), and the other is the split real form and corresponds to a lie group that is as far as possible from being compact ( its satake diagram has no vertices blackened and no arrows ). in the case of the complex special linear group sl ( n, c ), the compact real form is the special unitary group su ( n ) and the split real form is the real special linear group sl ( n, r ). the classification of real forms of semisimple lie algebras was accomplished by elie cartan in the context of ri
