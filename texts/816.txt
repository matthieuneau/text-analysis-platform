playing with equations to solve problems date : 09 / 16 / 2003 at 10 : 48 : 13 from : mara subject : to state the geometric property of an equation i need to give the geometric property common to all lines in the family x - ky = 1 i know that the answer is that all lines in this family have an x - intercept at x = 1 but i am totally clueless about showing why this is the case. at first i thought that using the double - intercept equation ( x / a ) + ( y / b ) = 1 would work but i couldn't get it in the correct form. then i tried to solve for x and y and got x = 1 + ky and y = ( - 1 / k ) + ( - x / k ) but now i do not know what to do with this. so i was wondering if you knew how to go about solving this? date : 09 / 16 / 2003 at 12 : 28 : 52 from : doctor peterson subject : re : to state the geometric property of an equation hi, mara. i don't think there is any method you can use to solve this sort of problem without a lot of thinking and testing. let's see how i personally would approach it ( as well as i can construct it, considering that i know the answer already! ). then i'll look at some alternative approaches you might take. we have x - ky = 1 and we want to know what property all these lines have in common. probably, since this is an open - ended question and i don't expect it to be straightforward, i would start by just " playing " with the equation, getting a feel for how it works by trying a few
