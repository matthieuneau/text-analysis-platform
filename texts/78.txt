now he ’ s alerted me to a new study and related lecture on what he and his co - authors are calling “ peak farmland ” — an impending stabilization of the amount of land required for food as humanity ’ s growth spurt plays out. while laying out several important wild cards ( expanded farming of biofuels among them ), ausubel and his co - authors see a reasonable prospect for conserving, and restoring, forests and other stressed terrestrial ecosystems even as humanity exerts an ever greater influence on the planet. the study, “ peak farmland and the prospects for sparing nature, ” is by ausubel, iddo k. wernick and paul e. waggoner and will be published next year as part of a special supplement to the journal population and development review, published by the population council. drawing on a host of data sets, the authors conclude that a combination of slowing population growth, moderated demand for land - intensive food ( meat, for instance ) and more efficient farming methods have resulted in a substantial “ decoupling ” of acreage and human appetites. here ’ s the optimistic opener : expecting that more and richer people will demand more from the land, cultivating wider fields, logging more forests, and pressing nature, comes naturally. the past half - century of disciplined and dematerializing demand and more intense and efficient land use encourage a rational hope that humanity ’ s pressure will not overwhelm nature. ausubel will describe the findings in a talk during a daylong symposium at his university on tuesday honoring paul demeny, who at age 80 is stepping down as editor of the journal. ausubel ’ s prepared remarks are online. in his
