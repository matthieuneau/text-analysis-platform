the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) spacecraft is expected to discover its 1, 000th comet this summer. the soho spacecraft is a joint effort between nasa and the european space agency. it has accounted for approximately one - half of all comet discoveries with computed orbits in the history of astronomy. " before soho was launched, only 16 sun grazing comets had been discovered by space observatories. based on that experience, who could have predicted soho would discover more than 60 times that number, and in only nine years, " said dr. chris st. cyr. he is senior project scientist for nasa's living with a star program at the agency's goddard space flight center, greenbelt, md. " this is truly a remarkable achievement! " about 85 percent of the comets soho discovered belongs to the kreutz group of sun grazing comets, so named because their orbits take them very close to earth's star. the kreutz sun grazers pass within 500, 000 miles of the star's visible surface. mercury, the planet closest to the sun, is about 36 million miles from the solar surface. soho has also been used to discover three other well - populated comet groups : the meyer, with at least 55 members ; marsden, with at least 21 members ; and the kracht, with 24 members. these groups are named after the astronomers who suggested the comets are related, because they have similar orbits. many comet discoveries were made by amateurs using soho images on the internet. soho comet hunters come from all over the world. the united states, united kingdom, china, japan, taiwan, russia, ukraine, france, germany, and lithuania are among the many countries whose citizens have
