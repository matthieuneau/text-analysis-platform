common core catholic identity initiative a national working group has begun the common core catholic identity initiative ( cccii ) to develop and disseminate resources and guidelines to assist catholic elementary and secondary schools in integrating elements of catholic identity ( catholic values, scripture, church social teachings, encyclicals, etc. ) into curriculum and instruction based on the common core state standards. the initial phase of cccii focuses on k - 8 english / language arts / literacy. resources for other subjects and for 9 - 12 curriculum will be developed in later phases. forty - six states have agreed to adopt the common core state standards, a set of high quality k - 12 learning standards that includes rigorous content and application of knowledge using higher - order thinking skills, leading students to college and career readiness. currently, catholic schools are assessing what the implications of the standards and accompanying assessments may be for them. while catholic schools have their own local or diocesan standards, their ability to continue to provide high - quality education for their students is compelling them to consider adoption of the common core standards. catholic schools will be impacted as curriculum resources and professional development opportunities become aligned with common core state standards by producers of instructional materials, college teacher preparation programs, or regulations for participation in the federal programs that currently benefit their students and teachers. within this environment, maintaining the uniqueness and integrity of the catholic school will require integrating the demands of their mission and the academic expectations of their constituents and the wider education community. to assist catholic schools with enhancing catholic identity integrated into the curriculum, the common core catholic identity initiative ( cccii ) has been launched as a collaborative project involving catholic universities, corporations and sponsors invested in catholic education, and the national catholic educational association ( ncea )
