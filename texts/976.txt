i have been enjoying reading all the posts on this thread.... thank you for sharing your work. i have one question. if as you say : " all the letters of the hebrew alphabet are contained in the letter bet ", why is it that the modern form of its shape is different from its ancient form? i would think that the original forms of the hebrew letters would be where design would be found if it were there. we know that the meanings of the letters did not change, but their shapes did... your welcome rose! for starters let me just say this : there is no linguist in the world that can confidently tell anyone where language or written writing originally came from. they cannot truly tell you that so and so writing came before so and so writing. all they can do is surmise. now, i will tell you from lengthy study that all written writing compiled from every known alphabet ( even chinese ) can all be linked to the hebrew block style of writing that first appeared when moses came down from mount sinai with the 10 commandments. we can see similarity in these letters even to cuneiform which is said to be the oldest. so what i estimate happened was that adam and eve originally spoke this language, and the 7th generation from them which was enoch ( who was recorded in his book as well as the book of jubilees and additionally the dead sea scrolls ) who was the first scribe of written writing which was shown to him by g - dis appointed angel'uriel '. enoch calls these'ketav einayim'( eye writings ). now through the centuries these letters became mottled and distorted ( but we can still see the similarities ). then the letters were revised
