even though the cnc machines require little human intervention in the development process of the end desired product, human intervention is still needed when it comes to the computer software programming for the cnc machines. a cnc machine programmer must understand the programming, so that they are capable of accurately telling the machine what to do. cnc machines a programmed through a sentence like structure that is written in a code that it understands. each axes that the machine uses, requires instructions for the development of the final project. if you forget to program one of the axes, the product will not turn out ; in the same terms, if you program wrong, the axes will do what the program tells them and not what you want them to do. a cnc machine operator helps on the other end. the programmer writes the code for the machine, but the operator is responsible for downloading the program into the machine and getting the machine set up to properly do the job. the operator may have to set up the tools in the tool holder for the machine, position the material that is needed for the job in the machine, and then start the machine. if the cnc machine operator is experienced, they will begin to learn the different sounds that the machine makes and will be able to tell just by the sound whether there is a problem with the machine. a more experienced cnc machine operator is required to do this type of work. once the machine completes the program and the work progress is done, operators may be switched. at this point in time, a less experienced operator can take over from here. usually cnc machine operators will start out at the lower level and gradually work their way up as they become more experienced in this type of machining. experienced cn
