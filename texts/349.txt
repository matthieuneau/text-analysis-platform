how do you get hiv? hiv can be passed on when infected bodily fluid, such as blood or semen, is passed into an uninfected person. semen is the liquid which is released from a man's penis during sex which carries sperm. it can be infected with hiv or aids when someone is hiv positive or is carrying the aids virus. this can happen during unprotected sex. for example when two people have sex without using a condom when one partner is already infected, or between drug users who inject and share needles. it can't be transmitted by things like coughing, sneezing, kissing, sharing a toilet seat, swimming pools, sweat and tears.
