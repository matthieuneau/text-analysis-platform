on monday the american library association will announce the winner of its highest award for a picture book, named for the great english illustrator randolph caldecott ( 1846 – 1886 ). why was caldecott so important? here ’ s an answer from maurice sendak, who won the caldecott medal for where the wild things are : “ caldecott ’ s work heralds the beginning of the modern picture book. he devised an ingenious juxtaposition of picture and word, a counterpoint that had never happened before. words are left out – but the picture says it. pictures are left out – but the word says it. in short, it is the invention of the picture book. ” * * * “ my favorite example of caldecott ’ s fearless honesty is the final page of hey diddle diddle. after we read, ‘ and the dish ran away with the spoon, ’ accompanied by a drawing of the happy couple, there is the shock of turning the page and finding a picture of the dish broken into ten pieces – obviously dead – and the spoon being hustled away by her angry parents. there are no words that suggest such an end to the adventure ; it is purely a caldecottian invention. apparently, he could not resist enlarging the dimensions of this jaunty nursery rhyme by adding a last sorrowful touch. ” maurice sendak in caldecott & co. : notes on books & pictures ( farrar, straus and giroux, 1988 ), a collection of sendak ’ s reviews and other writing for adults. the first quote comes from his essay “ randolph caldecott ” and the second from his acceptance speech for the 1964 caldecott
