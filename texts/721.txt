swordfish â€“ indian ocean swordfish is a large, pelagic species found throughout tropical and temperate waters around the globe. they grow at moderate rates and produce many eggs. in the indian ocean, swordfish are captured by fishing fleets from many nations including taiwan, spain, pakistan and japan. their abundance decreased through the 1990s and early 2000s as catches increased, but current swordfish abundance in the indian ocean is at a medium level. the majority of swordfish in the indian ocean are taken with pelagic longlines, and some with gillnets. these fishing gears result in minimal habitat damage, but may accidentally catch endangered and protected species like sea turtles. regulations for swordfish fisheries are set by the indian ocean tuna commission, but compliance with these regulations at the national level is poor. this fish may have high levels of mercury that could pose a health risk to adults and children. more mercury info here.
