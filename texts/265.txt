sarin was developed in 1938 in germany as a pesticide. its name is derived from the names of the chemists involved in its creation : schrader, ambros, rudriger and van der linde. sarin is a colorless non - persistent liquid. the vapor is slightly heavier than air, so it hovers close to the ground. under wet and humid weather conditions, sarin degrades swiftly, but as the temperature rises up to a certain point, sarin â€™ s lethal duration increases, despite the humidity. sarin is a lethal cholinesterase inhibitor. doses which are potentially life threatening may be only slightly larger than those producing least effects. signs and symptoms overexposure may occur within minutes or hours, depending upon the dose. they include : miosis ( constriction of pupils ) and visual effects, headaches and pressure sensation, runny nose and nasal congestion, salivation, tightness in the chest, nausea, vomiting, giddiness, anxiety, difficulty in thinking, difficulty sleeping, nightmares, muscle twitches, tremors, weakness, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, involuntary urination and defecation, with severe exposure symptoms progressing to convulsions and respiratory failure. breath until respiratory protective mask is donned. if severe signs of agent exposure appear ( chest tightens, pupil constriction, in coordination, etc. ), immediately administer, in rapid succession, all three nerve agent antidote kit ( s ), mark i injectors ( or atropine if directed by a physician ). injections using the mark i kit injectors may be repeated at 5 to 20 minute intervals if signs and symptoms are
