previous abstract next abstract session 40 - the interstellar medium. display session, tuesday, june 09 gamma ray burst ( grb ) explosions can make kpc - size shells and holes in the interstellar media ( ism ) of spiral galaxies if much of the energy heats the local gas to above 10 ^ 7 k. disk blowout is probably the major cause for energy loss in this case, but the momentum acquired during the pressurized expansion phase can be large enough that the bubble still snowplows to a kpc diameter. this differs from the standard model for the origin of such shells by multiple supernovae, which may have problems with radiative cooling, evaporative losses, and disk blow - out. evidence for giant shells with energies of \ sim10 ^ 53 ergs are summarized. some contain no obvious central star clusters and may be grb remnants, although sufficiently old clusters would be hard to detect. the expected frequency of grbs in normal galaxies can account for the number of such shells. program listing for tuesday
