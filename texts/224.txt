by roger fox i doubt the keystone project is even a real long term goal by transcanada,. certainly in the big picture keystone is only a single chapter in a much larger book. if you read this diary you will risk information overload, you will be offered numerous disparate data points that at first glance may seem unconnected. you will need to digest all the information offered, and then analyze. crude is is classified by the american petroleum institute ( api ) into light, medium, heavy and extra heavy crudes, by api gravity. if its api gravity is greater than 10, it is lighter and floats on water ; if less than 10, it is heavier and sinks. the albert tar sands contain crudes of api 10 or less that is called extra heavy or bitumen. heavy oil is defined as having an api gravity below 22. 3, medium oil is defined as having an api gravity between 22. 3 °api and 31. 1 °api, light crude oil is defined as having an api gravity higher than 31. 1. at a production rate of 3 million barells a day the tar sands can last for 170 years. this would also mean a hole in the ground visible from orbit. the keystone pipeline is only one of a couple of handfuls of pipeline proposals over the last decade in the western us, canada and alaska. alaskan nat gas is largely unexploited, and is used locally on the north slope. its estimated that 70 trillion cubic feet of nat gas can be found in alaska, a lot of it in the north slope area. there are at least 3 major proposals for nat gas pipelines from the north slope area and the adjacent mackenzie river delta in canada.
