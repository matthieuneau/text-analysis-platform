" or " that was a great game. " it may, however, attempt to settle questions such as " was willie mays faster than mickey mantle? " by establishing several possible parameters for examining speed in objective studies ( how many triples each man hit, how many bases each man stole, how many times he was caught stealing ) and then reaching a tentative conclusion on the basis of these individual studies. sabermetricians frequently question traditional measures of baseball skill. for instance, they doubt that batting average is as useful as conventional wisdom says it is because team batting average provides a relatively poor fit for team runs scored. sabermetric reasoning would say that runs win ballgames, and that a good measure of a player's worth is his ability to help his team score more runs than the opposing team. this may imply that the traditional rbi ( runs batted in ) is an effective
