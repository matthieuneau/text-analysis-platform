biological species emerge and disappear in the natural course of evolution. there have been times in the earth â€™ s past when mass extinctions have occurred, causing a large number of species to disappear in a short time. this is generally believed to have happened due to external pressures on ecosystems, or sudden shocks and catastrophic events. we are currently going through such a period due primarily to the impact humans have had on the environment, and on plant and animal habitats. some scientists believe that 50 % of existing species may become extinct in the next 100 years. credit : wikimedia commons
